            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>HAppineſs is the deſire and aim of all Men, and as the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral good things are to be had by labour and right means, ſo this being the comprehenſion of the whole, is to be attained likewiſe. There is no accompliſhing of worldly projects and deſigns, without ſucceſſion of time and endeavour; things being as<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>it were hidden, that they may be ſought; afar off, ſo they muſt go who will have them; and commonly future to exerciſe our diligence and expectation. Let the ſame be done immediately toward the great and principal end, as to the leſſer and ſubordinate, and none ſhall labour in vain; but the like care and conſtancy as is uſed in ordinary matters; then any perſon may be aſſured of the chiefeſt good. All other things are coveted after in order to Happineſs, though it be under the name of Pleaſure and Conveniency; there is an impatient thirſt after it from the Beginning; for beſides thoſe natural cravings after the neceſſaries of Life, Meat, D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ink, Raiment; yet this is not all, there muſt be ſome delight: There is Play and Divertiſment, and then changing that from one kind to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, from Childiſh to the more Manly (though too often miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken) enjoyments. There is an eager inclination after ſenſual Pleaſure, and outward Mirth: As to theſe the means muſt be firſt had; Money or Eſtate which are to be gotten, and then to reap
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:46484:4"/> the Fruit of his Labours; or who hath them already, he is not to lye or ſit ſtill, but muſt riſe and go forth to gather thoſe preſent and viſible good things; ſtill this is but the Happineſs of half the Man, the Body only, and yet to be acquired ſomewhat more requires alſo a ſatisfaction. The worſt part hath its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires and is not fed with Husks or Pebbles, but things convenient, ſufficient here is already found out, both for uſe and delight.</p>
               <p>Now let the nature of the Soul be conſidered, according to her firſt excellency and juſt inclination, as ſhe came out of God's hand, and for what deſigned<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whether there be any Objects pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for her, that they may be had alſo. Take the whole Man in conjunction, his ſpiritual part (if not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>led) ſeeks after Happineſs, as the other doth Health, Nouriſhment and ſenſible gratification. Whether the Soul is in growth, or puts it ſelf forth according to the capacity and increaſe of the Organs, ſhall not be curiouſly inquired; but it ſeems to partake of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection, and would come up towards Perfection. It hath an ignorance and blindneſs, which ſhould be taken away by degrees: A ſtubbornneſs and l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The great Queſtion all along will be, what the right, means are? for we are in a world of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termixture where is Right and Wrong, Good and Evil, Truth and Falſhood, Apparent and Real; and therefore muſt narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcern the one from the other. A right Knowledge carries through all, and acting according to that Knowledge. There is an eſtabliſhed and fixed nature of things pertaining to us Men; the viſible we know by ſence and experience, the inviſible by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Reaſon and the full aſſurance of Faith. Amongſt the various and ſeemingly perplext, they may be reduced unto two general ways: That of Gods Commandment, according to his preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed order and uſe of them, ſhewed forth in his Word, or in diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience and tranſgreſſion: He made them all at firſt <hi>very good,</hi> Gen. 1. 31. but evil, corruption, vanity and fal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hood came in; and now hath ſent his Word to inform us aright, that we may not be deceived, but ſo to uſe as not to abuſe them. It is the ſame to all Mankind, what he ſaith to that Nation, <hi>O Iſrael thou haſt deſtroyed thy ſelf, but in me is thy help,</hi> Hoſ. 13. 9.</p>
               <p>As a way is ſhewed to the things of the Fleſh, ſo of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:46484:4"/> for Man is made up of both; he doth already know and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour after what appertains to that, let him do the ſame to the other: He is to work out his Salvation and Happineſs, (which are both the ſame thing) for God worketh in him to will and to do, who hath given Grace and Power. <hi>If thou cryeſt after Knowledge, and lifteſt up thy voice for <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding; if thou ſeekeſt for her as Silver, and ſearcheſt for her as for hidden Treaſure: Then ſhalt thou underſtand the fear of the Lord, and find the Knowledge of God</hi> Pro. 2. 3, 4, 5. Thou ſhalt learn his Kingdom and Dominion o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver us Creatures, and acknowledge as moſt due our own obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and ſubjection; thou ſhalt fully apprehend the things per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to it, and what is contrary, or an hindrance. To him that perfectly knoweth what are the right and true means to Happineſs, the attainment is eaſie. To ſeparate the precious from the vile; to lay hold of the real good from meer appearances, to find out ſomething more then this World gives, (for which we are beholden unto Gods Revelation in Scripture) to obtain the ſure hope and expectation of good things to come. If a way is pointed out how any one may be happy, if he is endued with Power to go therein, for he may underſtand, and he may do; I think more cannot be deſired, unleſs he is forced unto it, which none is: But all are prompted with the ſame inclination as to eat when hungry. Indeed the ſpiritual part can be longer in ſuſpence without true Happineſs, then the Body its Nonriſhment; for it is a more excellent and enduring ſubſtance, yet it deſires that as much as the other being and ſupport.</p>

If any are not ſo, it is through luſt, intereſt or humour, which they think as ſome helps towards Happineſs, and therefore if they ſhould hinder the impartial inquiry after that, it is to be hoped they may be laid aſide. The utmoſt Happineſs of this World is to be free from as many Evils as poſſible, and to enjoy as much good as may be had in this ſtate of Humiliation and Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>
               <p>God would not have any Man to be perfectly and abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Happy as to this prefent time. Himſelf alone is <hi>the Bleſſed,</hi> Mark 4. 61. He is the Fountain of all Happineſs, and reſerves
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:46484:5"/> for thoſe to be Partakers thereof who ſhall be found worthy. The deſign of the following Diſcourſes, is, that we may prepare and make ſure of that above all things, and to paſs through here with more Comfort and fewer Evils then uſually Men do; But ſincere, compleat, and uninterrupted Happineſs is not to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected in this Earth, for it would take off our deſire from God and his Kingdom, and alſo we could not bear it according to the Capacity we are now in. There is to be ſeen by his wiſe providential ordering, a Succeſſion and mixture of Good and Evil, ſweet and bitter, and we have all things in an imperfect manner. But Man either not knowing or wilful going contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to this deſign of Almighty God would fain be truly Happy, and that preſently; with which Temptation the Devil prevails over him to revolt from God and break his Commandments, ſuggeſting a full Satisfaction may be had when it is ordained otherwiſe. As it always proves a miſtake, ſo moſt commonly the Perſon not recovering from it when he comes to know as much, it proves deſtructive and miſerable to him. Did he but patiently wait and ſtand ſtill, he might ſee the Salvation of God. The Lord doth deſign the Happineſs of his Creatures, and why are they not contented he ſhould go his own way in bringing to paſs his gracious Work? At firſt he made us without our ſelves, and now he would make us Happy with our ſelves, if we would not run before, but <hi>follow hard after him,</hi> Pſ. 63. 8. in the way he ſhews. Would we endure a little Travel before we come to Reſt, not miſtake in the Place, but hearken unto and obey what our God ſaith, <hi>Ariſe ye, depart for this is not your Reſt,</hi> Mic. 2. 20. Leave of that purſuit and fixing on temporal Happineſs, and ſeek for that which is to come. Every thing puts in mind of our im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection which is in order to perfection, ſo we are to move to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it, but not run out catching after what is not to be had. Our mortality ſhould teach us to breath after immortality, and the natural reſult is not to rear up a dwelling place as if we were to abide here forever, or to be lifted up with Proſperity as if we ſhould never be moved, but to look out for the eternal Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and that Kingdom which cannot be ſhaken. What ever we meet with is mixt and unſatisfactory, we again deſire what is not ſo, this ſhould put us upon ſeeking after thoſe pure and ſatisfying Pleaſures above. The things we ſee, handle and taſte are fitted for the Conveniency of our vile and dying Bodies, which they
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:46484:6"/> like well enough; but this prompts to go in the way for them to be made glorious and incorruptible. The Soul finds every thing empty and ſhort, whereupon ſhe pants after a proper fulneſs, which is only in the Fruition of the Godhead, with whom we would be eternally tranſported. Here is the miſchief and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, all outward Pleaſures if moderately uſed are diverſions, but if too much, they quite turn aſide out of the way. Even the diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions do mightily hinder; ſo that were the Man contented to go on and uſe them no more then needs muſt, he would infallibly arrive at the Bleſſed end: Paſs through this World in a conſtant ſmooth Temper: Chooſing rather to ſpend his time in the Peaceable Fruits of Righteouſneſs, then in the Clamorous but troubleſome Delights of Sin and Vanity; let his days fly over his Head in doing real Good, then ſnatching at what the World eſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Not to antedate his Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs expecting it perfect and enduring, which is to be ſo here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. And finally to ſpie out and avoid the deceitful appearances of it now, and to do whatever Conſcience and Reaſon dictates is to be done to ſecure unto himſelf immortality and Glory. Reſt is not to be had in tranſitory things, not Peace in a troubleſome World. Neither can earthly things ſatisfie Heaven born Souls, <hi>He that loveth Silver will not be ſatisfied with Silver, nor he that loveth abundance with increaſe,</hi> Eccleſ. 5. 10. And he who loveth Pleaſure may be ſurfeited, but never filled.</p>
               <p>Were Men really perſwaded, that theſe things are ſo, they would be freed from much trouble and diſappointment, for they deceive themſelves with vain Expectations and tormenting De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires. By raiſing ſuch a conceit of Happineſs they pine long for want thereof, and when had are diſcontented as before.

And though ſingularity is abhorred in Religion (the only way thereof) yet here 'tis affected by all: Every one would be Happy, but go his own way, which indeed are turnings out of the way, ſtanding ſtill, and going backwards.

When he hath already brought us into this World without our Conſent, and we heard nothing of it before, or if that was impoſſible, yet we are aſſured that Children will be born and of the future Generations, though he makes no ſuch particular diſcovery to us of that, as of our own future Condition.

               <p>All the Sons and Daughters of Men do groan within them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; thoſe many and different Actions of the World are to this end; none grudges any toil or pain for to have it, Who refuſes to do any thing to be Happy?

Wilt thou then Iook up unto God? <hi>Acquaint thy ſelf with him and be at peace, thereby good ſhall come unto thee,</hi> Job 22. 21. That word imports a full knowledge of him and his ways. Do'ſt thou think knowledge was given thee in vain? Wilt thou exerciſe that, and let it go before thy Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? Upon aſſurance thou will diligently uſe and ſeek to advance it; then prove all things, hold faſt to that which is good, thus doing thou muſt be Happy. If thou do'ſt prove all things, thou muſt prove the things pertaining to Gods Kingdom; and not paſs ſlightly over them as the manner of the World is; who dwell amongſt the Pots, run from one Evil to another, from this ſinful Pleaſure or Profit, to ſuch an Humour, Fancy or vain Opinion, and have not to do with what is Good, Truth and Reaſon. Theſe finding nothing but Trouble and Diſcontent, Emptineſs and Vanity lie down and ſink down under the Wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (and as they think remedileſs) Condition of mankind. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as they walk up and down in the Earth, a place of Miſery and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:46484:7"/> vexation, ſeek reſt and find none; but do not lift up their Heart to God in the Heavens, from whom alone is to be had all true delight and ſatisfaction. They follow after falſe diſquieting things, not minding the true Peace provided for the Soul. One would think thoſe miſtakes and deceits every where, ſhould drive them ſooner to this ſure Refuge, yet alaſs! ſuch ſtrangers are we naturally to God, that we are apt to ſeek help of every thing before of him; and if after all nothing is to be had, then we flie unto him as a reſerve and laſt reſort; hereby inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating, if we could be aſſiſted any other way, we had never came unto him. What baſe unworthineſs is in our nature? that ſhould deal ſo with our Maker, who is the Author of all things, even of thoſe we ſeek for ſuccour. God knows our ignorance, delighteth in Mercy, &amp; is pleaſed to admit thereof. But here is the failure again, that ſome do not turn to the Lord their God, nor are obedient to his voice. They take Religion juſt for a preſent <note place="margin">Dut. 4. 29, 30, 31.</note> eaſe, which if it doth not give forthwith, they become impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, raſhly and falſly concluding there is no good to be found in it; Every thing before they tryed to the utmoſt, but of this they do not make a full experiment. They would be contented in reference to other matters to part with any thing, or to wait any time ſo they may find good; but will not turn from every evil way, nor tarry the Lords leiſure, and ſo they go away without benefit.</p>
               <p>Could we be aſſured the things of God are for our Happineſs, we would be for them, which they are, or nothing in the World is. And it may appear they are equally for the good of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Man, as other things to the outward. All beſides may be diſproved and found inſufficient to quiet our reſtleſs and craving part. The wiſe <hi>Gentiles</hi> did come ſo far as to conſtitute the chiefeſt good in the practice of moral vertue, then which nothing did conduce more to the Peace and Tranquility of the mind. They did grope by the Wall-ſide of true Religion, but were not within; They did give atteſtation to the excellency of God's Ways, though they did not know him; all one as a reflex beam of light may through a crevis paſs into a low Dungeon without ever ſeeing the Sun.

That is ſituate within a Mans breaſt, and the rational part cannot ſubſiſt with meer conceits, but requires ſomething proportionable to her nature.</p>
               <p>It concerns every one what thoughts he hath within himſelf, <note place="margin">Luke 12. 17, 19.</note> and if he would act ſincerely for his own good, he ſhould firſt ſtrictly debate whether they be true or falſe; for if they ſhould prove wrong, he loſes all his foregoing labour, which might have been ſpent in obtaining a real good; and on the contrary becomes miſerable by a diſappointment. The general courſe of Mens doings, do turn upon one principal point; there being but one time of tryal, one main good or evil ſet before them, to which all the leſſer and ſingle acts do relate. There is one God over all, one rule of action in his Word, one end of everlaſting Happineſs or Miſery. And the ſeveral deeds done in the Body, are as ſo many ſteps to one or the other. The Law and the Teſtimony, and the Light in them, diſcovers the nature of all how many ſoever they be, and to what they lead. So again, when one is in any miſery or trouble he ſhould take heed how he ſeeks for eaſe and recovery, for otherwiſe the laſt error may be worſe then the firſt, and he may become more miſerable by what he thought would be a cure and remedy. Let him look and find out the cauſe. Have recourſe unto the lively Oracles, when he is in ſorrow and diſcompoſure of mind. Whether himſelf be not of the number of thoſe who are <hi>Like the troubled Sea when it cannot reſt, whoſe Waters caſt up mire and dirt,</hi> Iſa. 57. 20. And there his melancholy (as they call it) is the neceſſary effect of Sin and Guilt. Their Conſciences being wounded, they run up and down ſeeking a little Comfort, when they carry ſtill that along with them; they go from one place to another, here and there, and yet are not ſatisfied. By this means the deadly thing is not taken away, but ſticks ſtill faſt till it rankles and becomes inſenſate, ſo more dangerous. Some being hardened through the deceitfulneſs of Sin are not ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; how this occaſions preſent dulneſs or diſquiet, but impute it to natural diſpoſition, and faſly imagine to have a cure by what was the original cauſe thereof: Theſe acting contrary to Reaſon, meet with the uſual event of Folly. The pleaſures of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:46484:8"/> Sin are but for a ſeaſon, and after the ſeveral times are over; the melancholick fit returns as bad, rather worſe then ever. If they would ſuffer themſelves to be admoniſhed, how they nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther make uſe of the right remedy, nor apply it to the diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered part; for inſtead of taking away they feed the Diſeaſe, and uſe ſtupifying Medicines, which only take away the ſence but not prevent Death. The Sinner that labours under remorſe, will drink heartily, for ſorrow is dry, ſo endeavouring to drown the ſpirit within him, which though it ſink at night, will riſe again in the morning, and becauſe it tells him the truth, it is thought his Enemy for diſturbing him; And therefore he will try again to drive that unwelcome Gueſt out of his houſe, which cannot be done. Then continual Buſineſs, Recreation or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany ſhall divert its whiſpers: Otherwiſe by groſs Ignorance or ſtupid inconſideration he willingly becomes as bruit Beaſts, whom he obſerves to be diſturbed from nothing within. Thus he dreams of relief, as if he ſhould not die, and puts of what would do no other harm then lead him to Repentance, till it is hid from his Eyes.</p>

Now were they fully convinced, that could equally, yea more be had in obedience to Gods Commandment, theſe would live according to that, unleſs they are the greateſt Fools that can be imagined, conſidering the diſproportion of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of the one, and ſad Puniſhments that are to the other way. If the God of this World hath not blinded their eyes, and they are not altogether become Carnal who cannot diſcover any thing within, they may conſider the great difference of things ſet before us, Life and Good, Death and Evil, that they may chooſe the better and avoid the worſe. Evil hath a thin appearance of Good, and therefore is catched at and embraced; ſo Good hath an outward ſhew of Evil, and is abhorred and deſpiſed. At firſt ſight ſin and iniquity ſeem to further the Happineſs of mankind, but in truth is the Cauſe of Miſery; ſo righteouſneſs and obedience looked ſlightly on, appear to bring in convenience and diſturbance. Sin hath a ſhew of Wiſdom and Briskneſs, when in the Act it is folly, afterwards Tribulation and Anguiſh of Soul; the other at a tranſitory glance is fooliſh and dull, but upon full Tryal is the greateſt Prudence, perfect Peace and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction to the mind of Man. The deluſion and miſtake is, Men do not ſee throughly into things, nor look beyond the preſent unto the end, and conſequent of them; for if they did this, they would not be deceived in that greateſt Concern (for every Soul would have the one and eſcape the other) of Happineſs or Miſery. <hi>Judge not according to appearance but righteous judgment.</hi> That exceſſive Laughter and outward Noiſe (which ſometimes accompany the Pleaſures of ſin) make ignorant undiſcerning Perſons ſtand in Admiration of it.

Is this your utmoſt Happineſs that is mixt, broken of, and interrupted? Which day by day grows more tireſome, and ceaſes to delight. A whole Life ſo ſpent, as between the laſt riſing of the Sun and ſetting thereof, doth not ſatifie at the inſtant, utterly periſhes, and ſeems as if it had never been; thoſe Delights are not greateſt which make moſt noiſe, but rather ſhallow and haſtily run away, when true Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction like deep Water is ſilent and full.</p>
               <p>We may indeed ſhew forth outward Signs of Rejoycing, for wherefore hath God given us Powers ſo to do, if we might not Laugh? <hi>He that doth not afflict willingly nor grieve the Children of Men,</hi> (I am perſwaded) doth not delight to ſee a ſad Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, disfigured Faces, or a Head hanging down<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> like<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a Bulruſh, but Loves a cheerful Aſpect as well as a Giver. We may be Chriſtians and Men ſtill. Both merry and facetious as far as conſiſtent with the perfect Law of Liberty. We may uſe the Creatures and Recreations in a moderate way, and ſo they relliſh more then running to the full Exceſs of Riot. In the mean while we do not place our happineſs in them. We eſteem them as Bleſſings, and are thankful, but do not reſt contented being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned for greater things, we do not uſe them as the chiefeſt Good, nor conſume moſt of our time and care in them, as the manner of ſome is: Who therefore term us Melancholly and ſtupid, but themſelves are more properly brutiſh. Why ſhould they accuſe any one for not being exceeding Cheerful in thoſe things which cannot make the Owners ſo? That Aſperſion is generally caſt upon all Gods Servants, as if his ways were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Sowreneſs and Miſery, and ſo diſcourage others. It is unworthy to bring an evil Report of the Land they never ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, their words are not much minded who ſpeak evil of the things they know not. But it is much worſe in the Spies, who ſay they have knowledge and experience, if they do leſſen it in a whiſpering and indirect manner; it is becauſe themſelves did flightly view, and ſo away; they had a ſecret Prejudice before,

But had they went through, and into the midſt of it, diligently ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved all things, dwelt there for ſome time, the longer the better, they will perceive the Goodneſs thereof. By that time they have continued as long there as in the wilderneſs of ſin, they will like it much more; ſomewhat is to be allowed to a ſtate of Tryal, conſequently Temptations; an imperfect know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, thoſe remainders of Original corruption, which are ſo many weights that we muſt carry along in the Chriſtian race, but ſtill by Gods aid we can go through here with more Content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment then others in their ways. <hi>But ſeek ye firſt the Kingdom of God and his righ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The knowledge of God and Eternity make all things beſides ſeem little and momentary, for the greater will obſcure the leſs, as the Sun doth the Light of Moon and Stars. Now becauſe moſt ſay with their mouths God is their chiefeſt good, Heaven their end, when their Heart runs after temporal things; unleſs his Word did diſcover it in plain and true Sayings, we ſhould be at a loſs how to find out their Hypocriſie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or put a difference between making them the principal or ſubordinate end. Where is ſuch a cumbring about many things, and ſo little or lazy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the one thing needful; That earneſt care and greater degree of affection after one then the other, will manifeſt their Pretences to be lying and vain; for it is a certain Rule, Where is Faith and Love of God, that Man will not commit ſin, or leave Duty undone, to accompliſh preſent things. And if he did ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely intend for Heaven, he would not do thoſe things which lead contrary, as that Word (which makes known the place and way) doth expreſly declare. Men would not be ſo mightily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned for a moment (no more then they are for one Nights Lodging upon a journey) if they had a real Senſe of Eternity. If it was not for this great end, all Mens doings are vain; their

Whatever delights or afflicts, ſoon paſſeth away, and we are gone. To talk of their Good and Evil would be as impertinent, as now it is to lay down Rules for having the tickling of a Feather, or prevent the ſcratchings of a Pin. Their goings up and down would be as the moving of a ſhadow which is loſt in darkneſs. The deep thoughts of Heart dreams followed with a dead and eternal Sleep: Great ſwelling words like a voice crying in the wilderneſs inſtantly periſh, and ſignifie nothing. Thoſe fancied worthy and great Actions juſt carry on that ſmall Variety which is in the courſe of the World, but little more then what Beaſts do in their ſeveral kinds, all things would be ſmall and inconſiderable in this Life of Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, barely appear and be forgotten.

               <p>The rule of Action is the whole Scripture as it relates <note place="margin">of Actions</note> towards God, our Neighbour (all which may be judged of by <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 12.) and to our ſelves. Gods Glory is to be the end of all, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 31. By his word all the Actions of mankind may be determined whether good or evil. Where no Law is there is no Tranſgreſſion, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 15. And where there is either going contrary or leaving it undone, is Sin. Eſchew evil and do good, is a comprehenſive Command reaching to all our ways. The example of our Lord, Acts, 10. 38. is obligatory to all according to their Capacity and Station, to do what good they can whilſt in the World; to profit whom they are able, but to hurt none. Whether ye eat or drink, or whatever you do, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect is to be had unto God, for his Government extends over the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:46484:14"/> whole Man, even the thoughts and intents of the Heart. All the faculties of Soul and Members of Body, are to be made in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of Righteouſneſs unto Holineſs, which were before inſtruments of Sin unto Iniquity.</p>
               <p>This is a bleſſed change which every one would have, if he did throughly underſtand the true worth thereof, but an Enemy doth hinder, whom the Captain of our Salvation would enable to reſiſt, if he would follow the directions, and uſe the Power given him. He prompts and inclines when the other doth beat off. The Temptation is near the ſame with our Lords invitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, who promiſes reſt; the other makes a propoſal and offer of Happineſs. If the poor Man is overcome by cunning perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, then he is held Captive, he hath leave for a while to intoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate himſelf with Pleaſures, that he may not be ſenſible of his enſlaved condition. Outward objects are provided to divert him from looking within; by theſe, as Children with Toys, the Soul is deluded ſome time, but at length grows weary. He finds no real ſatisfaction in any thing, he knows not what to do, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience will move him towards Repentance. Then comes the evil one to affright him from conſidering of his ways. If the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil ſpirit is in danger to be caſt out, he doth foam and rage; the poſſeſt is in as great a combuſtion as if he were caſt into the Fire; and therefore ſome fearful Souls will rather endure the Bondage ſtill, then bear the trouble of driving it out; like ſilly Patients die of their Sores, rather then ſuffer them to be ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the bottom. But there are others who dare grapple with this power of darkneſs, Faſting and Prayer are excellent Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons; the Soul being freed from the clog of Meat and Drink, is more ſtrong and vigorous, ſo fitter for the Combate; by the latter he is called to aſſiſtance, <hi>Who for this purpoſe was manifeſt in the Fleſh, that he might deſtroy the works of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="24" facs="tcp:46484:15"/> through the Grace that came by Jeſus Chriſt. A Prize is put into our hands, which (if we have the heart to uſe the means) we ſhall certainly obtain. It is no great matter, only to obey the Goſpel, which is what a wiſe Man could chooſe to do, if no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence of reward was to be revealed hereafter, for ſuch true ſatisfaction (which nothing elſe can give) ariſes to the mind through well doing, that this alone is ſufficient motive.</p>
               <p>There is more ſincere Pleaſure in abſtaining from evil thoughts then yielding to them, the mind is ſerene and clear; and medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of good things is ſutable to its nature, hath neither Shame nor Repentance following it. What are called common and indifferent things, they do equally divert as what are ſinful and ſtrange. To ſpeak the truth is natural, there is no difficulty and trouble to find out evaſions, or avoid ſelf-contradiction. There is no danger for him to be entangled in his talk, who ſpeaks nothing but truth, for that is conſonant to it ſelf. Lying is ſhameful and hated, who are addicted to it would not be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſo, it is odious in the opinion of the worſt of Men.

               <p>Perjury is Infamous amongſt all Nations; ſome have thought no puniſhment too ſevere for it. God is highly provoked and diſhonoured, the forſworn Wretch as far as lieth in his power makes him an Inſtrument and Partner to his own deceit and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice: As if the fountain of Truth were falſe as himſelf, he calls him for witneſs to a miſchievous Lie. He prays God would help him according to the Truth he ſpeaks, but prevaricates that, and his prayer ſhall turn into his own Boſom, and ſo be deſtitute of his aid, without which he ſhall periſh. If God did not keep ſilence, none would preſume to do after this manner, and then could be no Tryal; but in the other World ſhall be found true what is written, Pſ. 50. 21.</p>
               <p>The Atheiſtical Diſputer (whom after-Ages will hardly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve to have ever been) is more plagued with fears of eternal Vengeance, then all the affectations of wit and applauſe amongſt his monſtrous Herd amount unto.

It is better and more hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py not to offend with the Tongue, then to let it looſe to its ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral kinds of Sin and Irregularity.</p>
               <p>As for Actions, What doth yield more real content then to do juſtly? The rules whereof none violates without Regret and Condemnation. There is an inward and ſenſible grief, when a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing is done contrary to the Law written in the Heart.

The abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of wickedneſs in our days is deſcribed, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 32, 33, 34. Some maintain their indigent Gallants, and ſteal from their Husband to gratifie them. Thus, and other kind of ways, they make their Beauty to be abhorred.</p>
               <p>Another inconvenience commonly attends it, Which is Folly: Not that I believe, God makes any one Fooliſh. All Souls are his, and there is no greater Diverſity between them at firſt, then the Stature, Similitude, or ſtrength of the Body. Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Ideots are found to be ſo from defect or irregularity of the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:46484:25"/> Organs within, as Blindneſs or Deformity without. But what goes commonly under the Name of Folly, is through our own fault and negligence. The mind is not improved for want of receiving in the words of knowledge and inſtruction, which are neceſſary to the growth and continuance in underſtanding, as Meat and Drink to the Fleſh. And then by not exerting, the faculties become dull and uſeleſs, as the ſlothful are unapt to work. This is the cauſe why Women in general are not ſo Wiſe and Learned as Men. Could we now ſee as God ſees, into the parts of the Soul, or as we ſhall when let ſlip out of this Fleſh, the Leanneſs and Blindneſs of ignorance, the Deformity and Crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs of Folly, that drowſie unactive Diſpoſition would be as much deſpiſed, and we ſhould equally endeavour to ſtrive againſt them, as now we do ſuch defects of the Body. But the World is only for viſible and preſent things, and if they are well enough, do not ſo much care for the inviſible and future; when Faith and Reaſon do aſſure theſe will be viſible and preſent alſo, of longer continuance and greater Concern. Whoſe chief aim is to recommend themſelves before others, one excellent thing to ſet them of is thought ſufficient, they mind no more. So in the preſent inſtance it comes to paſs that Beauty is without Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. All the Care and Education is concerning that, but not to accompliſh the inward parts; for all Pride, Boaſting, and Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceit, yet a King and one Skilled in the Female Sex hath left this Character, <hi>As a jewel of Gold in a Swines Snout, ſo is a fair Woman without Diſcretion,</hi> Prov. 11. 22.</p>
               <p>But ſuppoſe better; One who is Chaſt and Wiſe, Yet ſhe is ſubject to Accidents and decay. The Fruit of the Womb makes an Alteration in her Face, a fit of Sickneſs <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

To repair the ruins of time by Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements of Art, to fill up the Wrinkles with Paint and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milion, is to ſtrive againſt Gods appointment. And this is a preſage (which they ſhould take as ſuch) of falling down lower into the Pit, where is an utter end of this eſteemed Perfection.

Chriſtianity is to be judged of by its pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts and true examples, and not to be meaſured by thoſe who do not comply therewith. The bleſſed Jeſus had a Purſe-bearer for the poor, but we do not read that he had any thing more then to ſerve neceſſary occaſions; when they came to him for one Penny Tribute-Money, he works a Miracle to have that; and never is Recorded to have ſought any at all but at that time. <hi>Peter</hi> was not aſhamed to own openly, <hi>Silver and Gold I have none,</hi> Acts 3. 6. The other Apoſtles were in a like condition: Thoſe whom they Converted unto the Faith, had all things common, and ſold their Poſſeſſions and Goods, and parted them to all Men, as every Man had need, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 44, 45. They did deſpiſe what the World now doth magnifie; yet we pretend to follow the ſteps our fore-runner, and they are gone before; <hi>But care is to be had that we do not miſs of the place they are entred into, as we now vary</hi>

                  <hi>from what they were in this World.</hi> The young Man who had kept all God's Commandments from his youth upward, was rejected becauſe he would not go and ſell that which he had, and give to
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:46484:32"/> the poor, when he was promiſed to have Treaſure in Heaven; and it is immediately added of the hardneſs of a rich Man to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the Kingdom of God; from whence may be gathered, that to prefer any profit before the Commandments of Jeſus, If there is not a readineſs, willingneſs, nay actual doing the ſame when occaſion requires to loſe or ſell all worldly poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons <note place="margin">Luke 14. 33.</note> for his ſake and poor Brethren; if this mind be wanting, all ſignifies nothing, though he hath done never ſo many good acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons before. To come ſo near to Heaven, and not be admitted for want of one thing, makes the diſappointment worſe and more tormenting. Although many having the form of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs do love this preſent World, yet none doth ſo who is a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere and univerſal Chriſtian, as one muſt be, if he intends to find Good by his Profeſſion.</p>
               <p>But the natural Man diſcerneth not theſe things, they are fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhneſs unto him; and therefore it would be proper to ſpeak ſomewhat, whereof he is ſenſible. Perhaps he imagineth all the reſt to be talk, as now he begins to perceive what is done to be Vanity, a Dream, and next to nothing. However formerly he did hunt after what he thought was real, now he diſcovers it to be empty and vain, and therefore concludes the like of what is more told him. Not throughly conſidering this is a ſtrong evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the truth of God's Word, which before acquainted, as he did hear ſomewhat of the Vanity, Deceitfulneſs, Unfruitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of thoſe things; And then he would not believe, but now that is found true by his own experience. Why then may it not be ſuppoſed to be true, when it ſpeaks further of the continuance, greatneſs, and ſubſtance of things hoped for? If it is fulfilled in the leſs, why ſhall it not alſo be in the greater? If in things pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, why not in things to come? <hi>If I have told you Earthly things, and ye believe not, how ſhall ye believe if I tell you of Heavenly things?</hi> John 3. 12. But it is experienced by all what the Word ſpeaks of the fiction and falſhood of ſome things, ſo it is reaſonable to give regard when it declares the truth and reality of others. It is to be feared, and he is in time to be forewarned thereof, leaſt he be found a Fool in this as in former things, to know them only by after wit and experience. As he diſcerns not the Vanity and Deluſion of Youth, till that is over; ſo not to learn the things proper for a Man till that is paſt, nor the things of eternity till he is let into it, which is ſad; for an error here is without remedy. It is
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:46484:32"/> fooliſhneſs in an old Man to ſay, O that I had done thus, and thus in times of Youth or Manhood, when he might have done them then, and now they are paſt and irrecoverable. It is juſt the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſame as to thoſe things alſo, unto which through the Grace of God we endeavour to perſwade Men. And therefore ſuffer your ſelves to be put in mind, you are come to perfect underſtanding, judge of what is ſaid.</p>
               <p>It is a deceivable and lying conſequence, (with which the Devil doth tempt people to unbelief towards their declining years) that all things whatever are Vanity, becauſe they find it ſo of the things before them. Every temptation, if throughly conſidered, makes againſt him; for this confirms that all things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed are ſo as affirmed in Scripture. So they are not to be taken up as a reſerve, but to be ſurely believed; they are not to be look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon as conjectural notions of happineſs, but to be moſt faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and true, worthy to be truſted unto, if we had ten thouſand lives to be ventured upon them, or ſo much hope and deſire pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable to them. The inſpiration of God makes known the deceitfulneſs of all fanſied good here. That ſpeaks of every thing according to its very nature (either in expreſs words, or juſt conſequence) which belong to mankind from the greateſt to the leaſt, except what may be known from our ſelves, and the moſt common obſervation.

Neither let them imagine to draw up new Articles of Agreement, beſides that Covenant of Grace, God hath been pleaſed to eſtabliſh with Man, for that is only of his own

It is moſt juſt, that God who made us without ourſelves, never asked our Advice, whether we ſhould be formed Veſſels to Honour or Diſhonour, ſhould alſo give us what Laws he pleaſe, making his own Terms and Conditions, upon which we are to receive the Happineſs, whereof himſelf is the only Giver. We are not to frame any out of our own Brain, and offer them unto him; for ſeeing he hath created us to ſerve him, ſhewed us how, lent us Life for a time to do it, We are not to ſeek out new Devices, or to Parcel out this time as we ſee beſt for doing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. This is here mentioned, that thoſe may beware who think it ſufficient if they allot the leaſt Portion, nay the laſt moment for doing that wherefore the whole was given them. <hi>Theſe are the Statutes and Judgments, which ye ſhall obſerve to do all the days ye live upon the Earth,</hi> Deut. 12. 1. which is not taken away, but rather more confirmed under the Goſpel, as appears from, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1. 75. Who then would be ſaved? We learn from the Prodigal Son, the Publicans and Sinners, the joy over them that repent, thoſe many gracious Texts concerning it, that if we do go aſtray and come home again, we ſhall be received to Grace and Favour. But if Men from hence take occaſion to ſpend their days in wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and their Life in diſobedience; if they turn the Grace of God into wantonneſs, it is an horrible abuſe, and who thus per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the ways of the moſt High, may notwithſtanding their vain purpoſes periſh for ever. If they go on in their wicked Courſe, they may unawares be given over to a reprobate mind, and all their Thoughts whereby they intended to be reconciled unto God at ſuch a time, come to nothing. It is both unworthy and ſinful to put him of from day to day; and he who doth not Love to be mocked or deſpiſed, may reward ſuch after their deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings, withdraw his Grace, and let them go on in their own imaginations. What if one ſhould come into the Vineyard a little ſooner then needs muſt? Is not Heaven worth La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring all the day for? And can too much be done to avoid Hell?

He being but a Potſherd of the Earth, dares not be thus rude with his Maker, as to go before, for this would be the way to be excluded from his Preſence for evermore. We are to uſe all honeſt Care to preſerve our Life as long as we can, for Death is no ſuch trivial thing, as ſome ſeem to make of it through ignorance and unmindfulneſs. The Servant of God hath no reaſon to fear, for unto him it is an entrance into a Bleſſed Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, yet he would be rightly provided. What is to be done but once, all Wiſdom and Caution are to be had, that it be done well and ſure. <hi>If by any means I might attain unto the Reſurrection of the Dead, not as though I had already attained, or were already perfect,</hi> Phil. 3. 11, 12. Or if that were done yet, he is to tarry the Lords ſeiſure. What if he hath ſtood without his Fathers Houſe the Spring, Summer and Autumn? yet there was no great Hardſhip in them; if there was, it ſignifies not now, it is all paſt and gone. The worſt is behind, the Winter, (and that may be ſhortned, none knoweth how ſoon) but for the preſent it is ſomewhat irk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome to endure the Froſt and Cold, to have our head Hoary and our joynts Tremble. This doth make him more deſire, Come Lord Jeſus, come quickly; and it will be a greater happineſs when he doth come, but in the mean while he is not angry if not heard, ſee <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 36, 37, 38. If the body be waxed Old, the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:46484:36"/> Mind ſuffers no decay; the Seed ſown in Spring, cultivated in the time of ſtrength, yields a plentiful Crop, which doth good ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice in this time of need. <hi>They ſhall ſtill bring forth Fruit in old Age, they ſhall be fat and flouriſhing, to ſhew that the Lord is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right,</hi> Pſal. 92. 14, 15. The flower falleth, and the beauty there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is vaniſhed before the Fruit come, but this is better: So it is of the flouriſhing and lovelineſs of Youth, that is gone before good and worthy Actions are performed; but when they are done, the remembrance of them, and a well ſpent life is a mighty comfort to fading and decrepit years. If he cannot now enjoy the pleaſures of the World, that can be no vexation unto him whoſe mind is fixed upon better Objects, God and Chriſt. He being throughly convinced both by reaſon and experience of the vanity of all things here below, doth indeed pity, and not the leaſt envy thoſe who greedily hunt after them. Having the Wiſdom from above which is gentle, and eaſie to be entreated, he hath no peeviſhneſs of humour, and therefore he is not weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome nor hated like others of the ſame age. The Grace of God changes the whole nature, much more a ſingle circumſtance thereof. He is not in continual dread of the approach of Death, for that is the thing expected and deſired. The ſting of it is ſin, but he hath made it his buſineſs throughout his life paſt to pluck that out, now he can lie down in peace, knowing aſſuredly that day (which others ſo much fear) will be unto him the Birth day of Immortality. Neither is he afraid to conſider thereof before hand, for it doth not appear terrible to him who is reconciled with God, and hath laid up a Foundation by good Works which are ready to follow him. Having cleaved unto God in life and health he will not caſt him away in time of Age, nor forſake him when his ſtrength faileth. He that is his God will be his Guide unto Death; with this firm aſſurance he is bleſſed.</p>

                  <hi>But the ſinner being an hundred Years Old ſhall be accurſed,</hi> Iſa. 65. 20. and therefore is extreamly afraid to receive it. That ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died unmindfulneſs of his latter end, when Death dogs him at the heels, and is ready to gnaw on him, yet he puts of the looking thereon, and thence fooliſhly thinks all is well enough. An horrible dread and fearful expectation hovers over him, which he drives away as long as he can; ſome make a ſhew off much Mirth and Briskneſs, all for pleaſure and company ſtill; this is but a forced Joviality. However they pretend to have a Youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:46484:37"/> mind in a withered Body, in vain Paſtimes to skip like young Lambs, this they are the more obliged unto for to ſtifle inward Sorrow and fear. It is an eaſie matter, eſpecially by aid of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany and Senſuality, to make an outward appearance of what is contrary within, to laugh or make a noiſe when there is Vexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Spirit. 'Tis not only Age nor Conſtitution (whatever worldly and unbelievers talk) is the cauſe of Miſery, but it is principally occaſioned by Sin and Guilt, which others again are freed from by Innocency and Goſpel Righteouſneſs. Some are ſuch deceivers of themſelves, that they will rather think any thing a cauſe of trouble then their ſins. <hi>The way of the wicked is as Darkneſs, they know not at what they ſtumble,</hi> Prov. 4. 19. Natural weakneſs is common to all, as to which they are tormented and others comforted; but they are further ſubject to horrour and miſery, from which the Righteous are altogether freed: If the eyes of the ungodly are waxed dim, ſo that they cannot longer behold vanity, it is grievous to be bereaved of what they placed good in, eſpecially there being no Light within them, but their body is full of Darkneſs. If they are not able to fulfill their luſts, (in which was their chiefeſt delight) how wretched muſt they be? When the affection and deſire towards them doth ſtill remain, but the Members and Sences have loſt their power and reliſh. Thoſe which knew no other Happineſs but outward ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual pleaſures, and they have yet an hankering; what ſhall be done when thoſe are vaniſhed, and they have no other comfort or ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction inſtead thereof? They wiſh they had never been; Life is a burthen, which they would ſurrender up preſently, if they could be certain the Spirit would turn into ſoft air, and the body ever remain inſenſible as the Earth out of which it was taken, but they ſadly fear it will be otherwiſe. The oldeſt men if re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining in Irreligion and Wickedneſs, ſtill do deſire and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour after a further continuance of their life, though it be a ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of miſeries linked one upon another, and they have ſucked out, even to loathing, all Worldly pleaſures, and now cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy them. They are weary of life, and afraid to die, for they expect no good from it but evil. That puniſhment which attends for them till out of the body frightens when they are in, and the remedy they uſe, is not to think thereof. If they caſt a tranſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent glance towards the Grave, as ſometimes they are forced, they do not look beyond unto Eternity and future Judgment, for that
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:46484:37"/> raiſes trouble and anguiſh of mind. There is an inward ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion (which hath been ſtifled as much as it could) they are indeed afraid to appear before that God whom they have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked and offended throughout their foregoing days. This they were warned of all along by Gods Word and Miniſters, their own Conſcience, but having continually reſiſted them all, theſe Scriptures are fulfilled in them, <hi>Iſa. 6. 9, 10. &amp; 29. 10, 11. Rom.</hi> 1. 24, 26, 28. Talk to an old Man (who hath hitherto lived in diſobedience, and never left his luſts till they left him) concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Religion and exhort him to repent, it is the ſame as if you did to a bruit Beaſt. His ear is deaf and ſtupid to thoſe things, he underſtands as little of them as a Child. <hi>Strangers have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured his ſtrength, and he knoweth it not, yea, gray Hairs are here and there upon him, yet he knoweth not,</hi> Hoſ. 7. 9.</p>
               <p>There hath been ſome exhortation uſed to thoſe in the ſtate of Manhood, for if they are unconverted, they have the ſpirit of ſlum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, ſo they are more eaſily awakened; but the ſpirit of deep ſleep is poured out upon old hardened Sinners, and it is to be feared ſome of them will not be throughly rouzed, till they feel the flames of Hell about their Ears. This Age is not uſually better<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by reproof: Who are unjuſt will be unjuſt ſtill, and who are filthy will be filthy ſtill. However they may know, otherwiſe they ſhall feel, that <hi>God ſhall wound the head of his Enemies, and the Hairy ſcalp of ſuch an one as goeth on ſtill in his treſpaſſes,</hi> Pſ. 68. 21. Let all people take heed how they put off their turning unto the Lord till this time, for it is an unworthy thing after the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy hath ſerved divers luſts and pleaſures, and worn out in them, and diſabled any longer, then to offer it up unto him. Is it then a living Sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God? Is this a reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſervice? No, he diſowns the Blind, the Lame and Sick for Sacrifice, <hi>Mal.</hi> 1. 8. Is it meet that the Church of God ſhould be like the pool of <hi>Betheſda</hi> to be frequented by a number of impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Folks, of Blind, Halt, and Withered. Neither let any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume too much on thoſe who were called at the eleventh hour into the Vineyard, but the reaſon is there given, they were not hired before, and they came as ſoon as called. But here in a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Country, all are called to ſerve the Lord in their Youth; if they refuſe becauſe they think the day too long, and they fancy it well enough, if they go a little before Sun ſetting; will the great Houſholder thank them for it, and ſo be impoſed upon? In
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:46484:38"/> no wiſe, for which of you will be ſo ſerved? If your own work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſhould not come, or loyter all the day and do nothing till the time they ſhould leave of Work, would you reward ſuch baſe and negligent Fellows who thus deſpiſe and put a trick on you? God will be no more mocked or ſlighted by his Creatures, then they will be by thoſe under them. He is jealous of his Honour, and hates to have his commands diſregarded; with him is Power, Sovereignty and Wiſdom: Men muſt not think to give him an anſwer when they will, at ſome time hereafter, for now they have other buſineſs to do, or with <hi>Felix</hi> put him off to a more convenient ſeaſon. Let them deal thus with their Prince, and ſee how he will reſent it. God is not beholden to the Work of his hands, neither doth he receive any benefit by them; it is alone his infinite Goodneſs and Love, that he makes unto us any offer of Happineſs, and not our deſert who do all we can to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke the Author of our being. <hi>He hath not dealt with us after our ſins,</hi> Pſal. 103. 10. He commands to turn from them and be healed; it is meet and right (the diſtance being infinite of him over us) to anſwer him at the firſt call, which he doth again, and waits that he may be gracious, but he doth not for ever. <hi>Pharoahs</hi> heart was hardened after he had refuſed Gods meſſage ten times; and there are but few old Men in this Nation, who have hitherto continued in an unregenerate condition, but have more often reſiſted Gods Ambaſſadors commanding them in his name to turn and live, and therefore equally deſerve hardneſs of heart. But God who can raiſe the Dead, can raiſe theſe alſo out of the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thargy and Death of ſin; he can pluck theſe <hi>brands out of the Fire,</hi> Zech. 32. Yet there being ſo few ſincere and hearty converts of this nature; Oh my Soul, truſt not thou upon ſuch uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, to day while it is called to day harden not thy heart, but hearken unto Gods Voice; forſake thy ſins immediately, and then thou art ſure.

The breath in our Noſtrils hangs upon ſuch ſlender threads from within, and is ſubject to ſo many Caſualties from without, that if it were not for Gods providence who holds our Souls in life, we ſhould rather admire that any live ſo long, as die ſo ſoon.

               <p>The deſign of the Goſpel is to prepare us for better things, to bring us from Earthly unto thoſe that are Heavenly. <hi>Walk in the Spirit and ye ſhall not fulfill the luſts of the Fleſh, for the Fleſh luſteth againſt the Spirit, and the Spirit againſt the Fleſh, and theſe are contrary the one to another: They that are Chriſts, have crucified the Fleſh, with the affections and luſts,</hi> Gal. 5. 16, 17, 24. <hi>To be carnally minded is Death, but to be Spiritually minded is Life and Peace. For if ye live after the Fleſh, ye ſhall die: But if ye through the Spirit do mortifie the deeds of the body, ye ſhall live,</hi> Rom. 8. 6, 13. And then can be no greedy deſires after ſenſual Delights. An affection or hankering after them is the principal thing for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden, for there is large Commiſſion given, <hi>Gen. 1. 29. &amp;</hi> 9. 3. 1 Tim. 4. 4. A ſweetneſs is put into the Creatures, and ſence given us to perceive it; but they are to be uſed according to the bounds God hath ſet in his Word and our Nature. To be tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate in all things, and not the leaſt ſenſual minded, is what doth become Men and alſo Chriſtians; Neither let <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngodly Men walking after their own luſts</hi> think them leſs happy, becauſe theſe have not an unlimited enjoyment, as they wrongfully uſurp to themſelves; for the great God, who gives us all things richly to enjoy, may well preſcribe after what manner they ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, eſpecially ſeeing it is for our further good. Sobriety gives a better reliſh to every lawful delight, then all the ſtudied Sauce and Contrivances to thoſe who are full and Surfeitted. But then we do err not knowing our ſelves, for Nature doth not ſo much require Pleaſure, as now and then a little Divertiſement, but is for a middle and even State between Pleaſure and Pain;
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:46484:43"/> There may be obſerved a wearineſs of the former, if too long dwelt on, and the deſire of intermiſſion. <hi>Take Reaſon into Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice with Enjoyments, and then they will not be troubleſome or occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of inconvenience; but this is baniſhed becauſe it is thought to leſſen, only for that it conceives of them according to truth.</hi> Indeed the Act is little and mean, common to us with Beaſts, unſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying mixt and vain. When ſought after they are full of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and impatiency, and afterwards is Diſappointment and Vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. All which periſh in the uſing, and are determined in this Life; which ſignifie no more taken all together, then the ſingle interrupted Acts, all which go of as a Dream when one awaketh. So it is not poſſible for the true and real Happineſs to conſiſt in them; all this may Learnt as a Man.</p>
               <p>But then the Grace and Knowledge of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt teacheth more: That there is a real good ſet before the Sons of Men, that we are to preſs forward to it, and take heed leaſt theſe things hinder. There is great Talk in the World about following Pleaſure, and too much Practiſing of it; not minding how conſiſtent it is with Chriſtianity, and the Attainment of true Happineſs. Abſtain always from unlawful things, and ſometimes from lawful, may ſeem a rigid and ſevere Rule; but yet is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, for the Boundaries between good and evil are ſo ſmall and indiſcernable, that he which will venture to go to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of one, will before he is aware tranſgreſs, and paſs into the other: To prevent all Danger of this Nature, it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, <hi>Abſtain from all appearance of Evil,</hi> 1 Theſ. 5. 22. All Exceſs is Evil, even what are eſteemed the more innocent Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſements (if followed too much) do turn aſide the Heart from God and good things. The Apoſtle Prophecies of theſe laſt Days: That, <hi>Men ſhall be lovers of Pleaſures, more then lovers of God,</hi> 2 Tim. 3. 4. But it is ſtrange, that any ſhould be ſo, who really believe in him; for can they imagine he hath Communicated more Goodneſs to things then is in himſelf? That there is more Satisfaction in earthly Vanities then the things above? May they not more certainly conclude, that he purpoſely made things here ſo ſmall and empty, leaſt they ſhould take off our eſteem from him, that fulneſs of Joy, and the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures for evermore at his right hand? By theſe ſweet things he gives an earneſt, if we ſeek after it, and ſhall be found worthy, <note place="margin">Luke 16. 11, 12.</note> That, <hi>He will commit unto us the true Happineſs.</hi> And therefore

That Revelation which he hath made in Scripture doth diſcover it all as plainly as the Sun ſhineth in the Firmament, to ſee the things before us.

The Luſt of the Fleſh, the Luſt of the Eyes, and the Pride of Life, Pleaſures, Riches and Honour, are the baits he uſes; which make a Glorious ſhew and pretence to be the good things allotted to the Sons of Men.

(This is repeated again, becauſe it may be through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly attended unto,) Satan labours mightily that it may not be ſo

But let ſuch fooliſh reaſoners conſider this one thing at preſent (for more hath been, and is further to be offered to this point.) Whoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver lives ſinfully, either his Conſcience is ſeared or not: If it be, then he is become ſtupid dull and heavy; ſo whatever he takes, cannot long and thoroughly enliven him, and he is no more hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py then a Stock or Stone; Nay worſe, for he feels and cannot be rid of the manifold Miſery and Afflictions of Life, for which he dares not call up reaſon for comfort, becauſe it will Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter further thoughts, and plague him yet more. He doth not at any time enjoy true and real peace, the utmoſt is ſtupidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: If he is not yet arrived to this wretched condition, but hath ſome feeling within; then that bitter regret behind, and horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble dread of Eternal Vengeance further on, are more trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome then the empty pleaſure of a darling Sin, or Momentary eaſe of gratifying a luſt. When he conſiders, he finds more Anguiſh and Vexation of Mind in one hour, then the Joviality of many days amount unto, and therefore he muſt be inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, or he can take no comfort in his life, ſo the utmoſt of a wicked Mans happineſs is ſtudied Acts of Inadvertency. Let him move where he will, a Companion goes along with him, and when he is free from Company or Buſineſs (and even amidſt them) drops in a ſilent thought, which vexes him that will not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply therewith.</p>
               <p>There are who laugh at this word Conſcience, turning it into ſport and ridicule; but who ſeem to ſcoff at it in others, perhaps at the very time find its turbulent motions in themſelves; and if with ſcrued countenances they make a ſhew of much Mirth, yet the contrary is within, and whilſt they wittily deride the Rod, themſelves are ſmarting under it.

The firſt goes off and is remembred no more, but this riſes up in Sickneſs or Affliction: None is much diſpleaſed with himſelf for not doing of things which he never did before, eſpecially if they have a ſhew of inconvenience; but Conſcience prompts to the firſt act of duty, though never done heretofore, and expoſes to hardſhip and danger. It pricks on our Sluggiſh Nature to do ſuch things, God requires in his Word by ſincere Application thereof to our ſelves, though we would be glad of an excuſe not to do the ſame. Another particular is to be obſerved, which doth evidence the real diſtinction between Good and Evil as declared in Scripture; for when the mind is in ſuſpence and even between them both, as with young Perſons, if they do that which is good, they have no Condemnation for the ſame, but only when they leave it; ſo in Evil there is preſent regret, which continues till forſaken; and how long ſoever one hath been accuſtomed to this, there may be a little wiſhing to the contrary at firſt, but joy and gladneſs ſpring up when one hath perfectly recovered from it.</p>

               <p>Theſe and ſuch like inferences Conſcience doth make, and falls out with the beloved ſin; there are indeed ſeveral Whims and Fancies, with which the Man doth endeavour to ſtop the grumbling within, but yet the mind cannot be thoroughly ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as to the Foundation of a preſent peace and ſolid comfort, or aſſured hope of future Happineſs. What Peace, as long as ſin hath Dominion over him? He may go on in a courſe of Godlineſs, make a ſlight and partial Examination of his Life and Actions, but if he doth it thoroughly, then he is troubled with that breach of the Law; nay, all the other things in which he doth well, do not yield relief Equivalent to the Vexation for this one thing wanting. It is pity that thoſe who have advanced a good way, ſhould not go further; that they ſhould be ſuch Enemies to their preſent Peace, and endanger their future ſafety as to loſe that, and the benefit of what they have wrought only to gratifie ſome ſinful Luſt or Intereſt. The Pleaſure or Conveniency of that cannot make amends for the want of ſo much Good and Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, which is occaſioned only by this accurſed thing. By one poiſonous Herb death is in the Pot, ſo this takes away all the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light from the practiſe of Religion. And other People looking on theſe Examples cannot think, neither do they find that it makes men Happy, but Miſerable; for they ſee, and theſe expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimentally know themſelves to be ſad and ſorrowful in perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of Holy Duties. When they hear and read the Word, they find no Comfort, becauſe that convinces of Sin. Whoſe Hearts are clogged with Guilt, it is aukward to lift them up to that God, who hath no Pleaſure in wickedneſs. If at any time they are devout at the Ordinances; then peradventure they meet with greater remorſe of Conſcience for the reſerved iniquity, which makes them dull, and think the Worſhip of God an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſant work.

Strange! That Men ſhould be enraged againſt the Conſultations of their own Security and Happineſs, That they ſhould willingly keep themſelves from Satisfaction of Mind.

Yet this is not ſo grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous as may be imagined; for when thoſe Luſts (as dear to a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Man, as the Members of the Body) are rooted out, the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour is irkſome for the preſent, but afterwards Joy and Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction ſpring up. They did for a Seaſon pleaſe the brutiſh part, yet that train of Guilt dragged after, did wound the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward parts; the Pain there did exceed all the Sweetneſs he ever had by the ſudden Enjoyment: For the faint delight of a ſmall time, his whole Life was rendred Miſerable. But when they are driven out, the Anguiſh goes off in a perfect Cure, and there ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds the delight of a ſound mind.

               <p>The peaceable Fruits of righteouſneſs are to be had by thoſe, who are purified from all iniquity, who have knowledge in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Matters, and do according to it. <hi>If ye know theſe things, happy are ye if ye do them,</hi> John 13. 17. and miſerable are they, who do not. Who have taſted the good Word of God, every thing done contrary thereto, doth grieve and vex them. This is laughed at under the name of tenderneſs of Conſcience, but it intitles to the favour and acceptance of the Almighty, if he is careful not in the leaſt to offend. Who ſtudies in all things to approve himſelf unto God, and cares not if by ſo doing he gets the ill Opinion of others. If Conſcience be Evil, the Praiſe of Men will not make it good; but if good in it ſelf, the Tongue of

If any (as none ever yet did) ſhould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs all that he ſought after, he would be diſſatisfied, yea more then when he firſt began; for he hath ſpent his days and ſtrength in a vain thing.

               <p>Thus hath been ſhewed how our will and deſire perverted by Original corruption and Additional Sin, may be right framed by the Goſpel of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who was ſent to make up for <hi>Adams</hi> Tranſgreſſion.

Col. 1. 29.

Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral faculties are no more our own, then the Grace of God, for he is the maker and giver of both; But they may be uſed, and lifted up towards Spiritual things. Otherwiſe what doth it ſignifie to exhort People to Duty? All Preaching would be vain, and if they could neither underſtand nor do, it would be as ridiculous a thing to declare the Word in the Congregation, as among an herd of Cattle, or uttered to the Trees of the Forreſt; <hi>Incline your Ear, and come unto Me; hear and your Soul ſhall live,</hi> Iſa. 55. 3. Which doth manifeſt they might, if they would; <hi>They refuſed to hearken, and pulled away the Shoulder, and ſtopt their Ears, that they ſhould not hear,</hi> Zech. 7. 11, 12. Which doth moſt plainly imply that they might have done otherwiſe; There is an idle pretence too com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon among Men, for when preſſed to this or that Duty, the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe is, I cannot do this, whereas if they would make uſe of the means (which are in the power of all) they may have further aſſiſtance ſufficient to do what is required of them. Some hence take occaſion to live habitually in groſs ſin, and others in all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Wickedneſs; but the great judge of all Men will be no more put off with ſuch kind of tricks, then themſelves will be

And the ſecond is like, namely this, Thou ſhalt love thy Neighbour as thy ſelf,</hi> Mark. 12. 30, 31. <hi>For this thou ſhalt not commit Adultery, thou ſhalt not Kill, thou ſhalt not Steal, thou ſhalt not bear falſe Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, thou ſhalt not Covet, it is briefly comprehended in his ſaying,</hi>
                  <pb n="99" facs="tcp:46484:58"/> Rom. 13. 9. Love to God and ones Neighbour is the Whole Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Man; That keeps from offending the Moſt High, and alſo from doing the leaſt injury to our fellow Creature; for ſelf-love cannot endure any ſhould be done to our ſelves: Saith the beloved Diſciple (who makes good the denomination, by inculcating and repeating this word over to the utmoſt delight,) <hi>This is the Love of God, that we keep his Commandments: and his Commandments are not grievous,</hi> 1 John 5. 3. By theſe two general, judge of all that come under them; there is no Torment in Love, but all Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Satisfaction; it receives greater degrees according to its object.</p>
               <p>And then how exceeding muſt that be, which ariſes from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite God? The joy of that Soul is unexpreſſible, who perfectly love him: That ſtrangers may conceive ſomewhat thereof, and come over to partake of it; if they would be fully convinced in the Heart, what every one will own with the Mouth, it is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to lay down particularly; there is all the reaſon in the world that we ſhould love God, yea the very ſame why we love any thing. This is either the excellency of the thing it ſelf, or the kindneſs and actual good it doth unto us; upon all which God deſerves our utmoſt and whole affection: He is the excellent One, the Sum of all perfection.

Will they do their utmoſt, and perſecute him to the Death? As they did to the Prophets, the Lord Jeſus and his Saints; yet after they have done that, they have no more that they can do: They intitle him to a Crown, which the Lord hath promiſed to ſuch; ſo when he comes to ſuffer, he may well ſay with him, <hi>(Who ſuffered for us, leaving us an Example, that we ſhould follow his ſteps,) Father forgive them, for they know not what they do:</hi> When by the Eye of Faith he ſeeth the Heaven opened, he may with real Charity, and ſincere Affection cry out. <hi>Lord lay not this Sin to their Charge.</hi>

Theſe hear the Goſpel, which ſaith, <hi>Be ye kind one to another, tender hearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Chriſt's ſake hath forgiven you,</hi> Eph. 5. 2. One would think there was no ſuch thing as Love mentioned, if he were to judge by the Actions of ſome People. This is no ſlighting Matter, or as ſome would make it a piece of Bravery, in that they can live contrary to Rules and Preaching, for it will be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined what the end of thoſe muſt be, who obey not the Goſpel. Hatred is contrary to Chriſtianity as bitter to ſweet, or is poſſible for things to be one to another. Let one do never ſo many Acts of Worſhip and Devotion, yet if he liveth in Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice and Revenge, Strife and Envying, Hatred and Variance, he hath the Name and ſhew of Religion, but nothing of the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit and reward thereof. <hi>In this the Children of God are manifeſt, and the Children of the Devil, Whoſoever doth not righteouſneſs is not of God, neither he that loveth not his Brother,</hi> 1 John 3. 10. <hi>If he ſaith, he is a Chriſtian, he is not, but of the Synagogue of Satan,</hi> Rev. 2. 9. the Author of all black and corrupt Principles.</p>

Nothing can be more laſting and ſure, if upon that alone without the rotten Prop of Worldly and ſiniſter Reſpects. Whatever ſome pretend to generous Nature or Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility, none is like that which reſults from Goodneſs and Duty. The chiefeſt Love is to be ſhewed forth to thoſe of our own Profeſſion, but yet to be extended unto all, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 45. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 1, 3, 4. for though at preſent ſome are Strangers from the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace, yet we know not how ſoon they may come in; however we are to love them as they were made after the ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude <note place="margin">Jam. 3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 9.</note> of God, and are our Fellow Creatures. <hi>Honour all Men, Love the Brotherhood,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 17. <hi>If it be poſſible as much as lieth in you, live peaceably with all Men,</hi> Rom. 12. 28. What can be more reaſonable? Hereby a Man is freed from all the torment of malice, envying and ſtrife; he is not diſturbed with thoughts of revenge, or knawing reproach of others, which are as ſo many Wracks and Inſtruments of Cruelty, to thoſe who give way to theſe Sins. On the other hand, if there be any Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction in Love, any Bleſſing in Peace, any good in mutual kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and affection, he enjoys all this. In this word Love, all the Law is contained and obedience; ſo as a neceſſary Concluſion from this, all manner of Happineſs.</p>
               <p>A Second Paſſion is Fear. At firſt ſight it may ſeem ſtrange <note place="margin">Of Fear.</note> that this which troubleth and afflicts Man, ſhould alſo conduce towards his Happineſs. But God having ſet down ſuch Decrees for our Salvation, as expreſſed in Scripture, this is neceſſary to attain it. God was pleaſed to take this way to be glorified, as to the Inhabitants of the Earth; to declare his Sovereignty over the work of his hands, to ſet up his Kingdom and Government over us, to which are annexed Rewards and Puniſhments proportionable to the great King, who hath prepared them. <note place="margin">Mal. 1. 14.

None thinks hardly of an Earthly Prince, for puniſhing obſtinate and ungrateful Rebels: Nay, themſelves if they have
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:46484:62"/> any Reaſon, muſt acknowledge they ſuffer their deſervings. So it is of Gods dominion over us: His infinite Majeſty and Greatneſs require all Honour and Subjection; His goodneſs appears, that he had rather People would live quietly and obediently under his Laws. <hi>I drew them with Cords of a Man, with Bands of Love,</hi> Hoſ. 11. 4. So that if there was any remainders of Noble Nature and ingenuity, they might be prevailed upon by his Goodneſs. But alas! we are averſe to him, the Author of all Good we ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; we ſtruggle, we give backwards and break theſe Bands aſunder. His love is deſpiſed, then he ſends forth Threatnings if they will reduce to his obedience; and if they do not, Sentence is to be executed accordingly. If men will not love him, they ſhould fear him, and that will bring them over unto his love.</p>
               <p>He ſhould be the chief Object of all the Powers of our Soul. <hi>Sanctifie the Lord of Hoſts himſelf, and let him be your fear, and let him be your dread,</hi> Iſa. 8. 13.

Would not he who now commits Sin, becauſe it ſeems to him ſweet and pleaſant, fear to drink of the bitter dregs of the Cup of Gods wrath, and to ſuck them out?

If it be not agreeable with the Goſpel, Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is it ſo often ſpoken of therein? <hi>John</hi> (who was ſent to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the way of the Lord) Preaches of the Wrath to come and unquenchable Fire, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. 7, 12. A little after, the Author of the New Teſtament ſpeaks <hi>of utter Darkneſs, weeping and gnaſhing of Teeth,</hi> Mat. 8. 12. <hi>Everlaſting Fire and Puniſhment,</hi> Mat. 25. 41, 46. The like was the Doctrine of his Apoſtles, 2 <hi>Pet. 2. 9. 2 Pet. 3. 7. Rev. 9. 6 &amp; 14. 10, 11. &amp; 16. 10, 11. &amp; 21. 8. Jam. 2. 19. &amp; 5. 5. Jude</hi> 5, 6, 7, 13. Laſtly, he who came after them all, as one born out of due time, delivered the ſame, 2 <hi>Theſ. 1. 9. Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therefore the terrour of the Lord, we perſwade Men,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 11. So thoſe, who make this objection, differ in judgment from him and other Holy Men moved by the Holy Ghoſt, for they uſed this kind of Doctrine. Should they not now Teach, as Chriſt himſelf did, whoſe Embaſſadors and Stewards they ſay they are? Have
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:46484:64"/> they not him for an Example? Are they wiſer then he? Why ſhould not all the Arguments, which God hath given in Scripture, be made uſe of to exhort unto Duty? amongſt which this is power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and apt to prevail; for though indeed Love is the moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and abiding principle of Obedience, yet the terrours of the Lord do more effectually perſwade Men, which will drive when the other grows faint and languiſhing. Becauſe of the little ſmart and irkſomneſs, there is an unwillingneſs to ſpeak or hear there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; but it is an odd kind of Mercifulneſs to let Souls drop into Hell, rather then a little diſturb them before hand with the rumour thereof, and they had better ſuffer that then the thing it ſelf. This brings moſt people unto repentance, for they look about themſelves, and think what will be the event of a wicked life continued in. The word every where denounces Wo and Curſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Tribulation and Anguiſh againſt it, and their own Conſcience accuſing them of ſin, and that they are now ſubject unto all thoſe threatnings which they will certainly feel, unleſs ſome way avoided. All men, even the wicked and ungodly, do abhor miſery; and would flee from it if they ſaw it coming, and therefore they turn from iniquity leaſt it ſhould be their ruin. This converſion proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from ſuch motives as God hath given in his Word, is accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table with him; <hi>By faith Noah being warned of God of things not ſeen as yet, moved with fear</hi> (obſerve that) <hi>prepared an Ark to the ſaving of his Houſe,</hi> Heb. 11. 7. <hi>And others ſave with fear,</hi> Jud. 23. After our Lord aſſures us of the joy over one ſinner that repenteth, <hi>Luke</hi> 15. He brings in the parable of the Prodigal Son, who was ready to periſh for hunger; the conſideration of that, and not any love to his Father cauſed the reſolutions of going home, yet he was kindly received who was ſo little worthy of it. So one rou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed up with fear comes to repentance, and ſeeing Gods wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful compaſſion towards him, notwithſtanding his former ſins and provocation, which are all pardoned according to his gracious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1. 18.

For having peace towards God and forgiveneſs of paſt ſins,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:46484:64"/> he is not tormented with affrightful thoughts of Damnation; for though heretofore he <hi>was an Adulterer, or Covetous, or a Drunkard, now he is Waſhed, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

It is the conſtant ſtile of the Old Teſtament, and alſo a Goſpel precept, <hi>Fear God,</hi> Luke 12. 4. 1 Pet. 2. 7. We are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe obliged to be ſomewhat fearful concerning our own Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Heb. 4. 1. Rom. 11. 20. Phil. 2. 12. 1 Pet.</hi> 1. 17. To do this is not Tormenting, but ſtirs up carefulneſs, and puts upon all things to ſecure it, <hi>Happy is the Man that feareth always,</hi> Prov. 28. 14. From which proceedeth a good Life, thence a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and then is no fear; none that is Slaviſh or hath Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>A third Paſſion is Joy, which word denotes Happineſs, and is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten <note place="margin">Of Joy.</note> enjoyned in Scripture; for thou commandeſt all things which may do good, O thou Lover of Souls. <hi>Let the Righteous be glad, let them rejoyce before the Lord, yea let them exceedingly rejoyce,</hi> Pſal. 68. 3. <hi>Behold my ſervants ſhall rejoyce. Behold my ſervants ſhall ſing for joy of heart,</hi> Iſa. 65. 13. <hi>Thou ſhalt rejoyce before the Lord thy God in all that thou putteſt thine hand unto,</hi> Deut. 12. 18. This joy is not taken away, but increaſed under the Goſpel; <hi>The ranſomed of the Lord ſhall return and come to</hi> Zion <hi>with Songs, and everlaſting joy ſhall be upon their heads,</hi> Iſa. 35. 10. This the Prophet who ſaw his coming foretold, and ſo it was at the firſt appearing of Chriſt our Lord, <hi>Luke</hi> 2. 10, 11. He having now accompliſhed the work for which he was ſent into the World, there is ſufficient matter of gladneſs. Many righteous Men have deſired to ſee theſe days; The whole Goſpel, by which is eſtabliſhed a better Covenant, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports what the Apoſtle doth repeat in his exhortation, as if it could never be preſſed enough; <hi>Rejoycing in the Lord always, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain! ſay rejoyce,</hi> Phil. 4. 4. <hi>This is the Lord we have waited for, we will be glad and rejoyce in his Salvation,</hi> Iſa. 25. 9. Which is the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of Heaven, the clear manifeſtation thereof to the World,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:46484:65"/> and the poſſibility we are put in to partake of it. As then it will be a delight to remember how we came through this dark and troubleſome Vale; ſo whilſt we are here, we ſhould lift up our hearts with expectation thereof. Accordingly the good Men of old time did, who had but the Glimmering whereof we have the fuller Light: If the heir of a Kingdom or a good Eſtate is ſo tranſported with conceits and fancies of future good, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be thought abſurd, that who have the evidence and hope of ſuch an exceeding eternal bleſſedneſs (which will be one day revealed) ſhould be proportionably pleaſed with the foreſight and <note place="margin">John 16. 22. Gal. 3. 22.</note> aſſurance thereof. Accordingly that Chriſtian who hath a real intereſt, hath alſo a ſenſible rejoycing therein, which doth exceed all the pleaſures and imaginations here. What reſults from groſs and ſenſual things, is not worthy to be compared with pure and ſpiritual; yet God as a moſt Bountiful Maſter to his Servants, hath given them many things here for recreation and delight: He doth deny nothing which is good and convenient for us; We are all to admire and comply with the Riches of his Mercy and Love, who hath placed into our frame this affection of joy, and hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided things proper for it, and hath done as much as lieth on his part to compleat the great end of our being happy.</p>
               <p>How then came Sorrow in? God made it not, neither hath he pleaſure in the grief of the living; but it came in through Sin and <note place="margin">Of Sorrow</note> Tranſgreſſion, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15, 16. It was the effect of mans own diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience, and was juſtly inflicted on him as a Puniſhment, ſo it is continued of every ſin beſides. As ſuch God ordained it, but in the beginning when he made Male and Female, he did not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plant it into our nature; we now come into the World crying, for we fell and were corrupted with our fore-father; Sin is inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woven into our very fleſh, and as the neceſſary conſequent thereof ſorrow alſo. The Conception and Birth of our Lord was diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from ours; in him was no ſin, yet when he came into the World to make his Soul an offering for ſin, <hi>He was a Man of Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, and acquainted with Grief. The Lord hath laid on him the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Iſa. 53. Mark 14. 34</note>

My Fathers indignation is paſt, they are all over, and the remembrance is not in the leaſt grievous, now I am crowned with Glory and Honour. But weep for your ſelves who are in the Wilderneſs, for the tribulation in the World; and more eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally weep for thoſe ſins which occaſioned what I did ſuffer; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake them, and come to me: If ye pretend to be ſorry for me, and this doth not follow, that is, to cry out Hail King of the Jews, and crucifie him afreſh, and put him to open Shame. He hath inſtituted an holy Feaſt for the continual remembrance of his Paſſion; the reaſons thereof are to ſtir up our love towards him, and the hatred of our own Sins. God hath manifeſted his diſpleaſure againſt them by the Death of his own beloved Son, who came out of his Boſome; yet when he took ſin upon him, had the full Vials of wrath poured forth, as is evident by his Ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and bloody Sweat, by the pains he endured on the Croſs; His ſufferings were ſo exceeding, that none but <hi>he who travelled in the greatneſs of his ſtrength, who was mighty to ſave,</hi> and therefore could endure.</p>
               <p>The conſideration of which ſhould make us abhor our ſelves, and repent in Duſt and Aſhes, to mourn and be in bitterneſs for thoſe ſins which have ſlain the Prince of Life. This is that ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row required under the Goſpel, <hi>for Godly ſorrow worketh repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to Salvation not to be repented of; for behold this ſelf ſame thing that ye ſorrowed after a godly ſort, what carefulneſs it wrought in you, yea what clearing of your ſelves, yea what indignation, yea what fear, yea what vehement deſire, yea what zeal,</hi> 2 Cor. 7. 10, 11. If it were
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:46484:66"/> troubleſome, yet to obtain theſe good fruits none ſhould refuſe it; but our Gracious God hath ordered for the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement of all, ſome ſweetneſs therein; In the midſt of ſuch ſorrow the heart is light and cheerful, which ſeems abſurd and fooliſh to carnal Men; yet who have had ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere contrition, know it to be true; even whilſt they were pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth penitential tears, gladneſs was in the inward Man. Let not this paſs off for ſtrange, for if in the midſt of laughter the heart is ſorrowful, why may it not be alſo joyful in the midſt of weeping? <hi>Thus ſaith the high and lofty one, that inhabiteth eternity whoſe name is holy, I dwell in the high and lofty place, with him alſo that is of a contrite and humble Spirit, to revive the Spirit of the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones,</hi> Iſa. 57. 15.

Our infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities and imperfection do take away the feeling thereof; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we have the more, as they go off, and are endeavoured againſt: God is not far from us, but our iniquities ſeparate from him; he doth not ſo much hide his face, but our ſin and weakneſs, like a curtain before the Soul, intercepts the ſight thereof. None need to be diſcouraged, or think the King of Kings will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard him, becauſe of his ſmall and mean condition; there is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther gracious promiſe, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66. 1. 2. Some do highly eſteem a kind word, or pleaſant aſpect from a great perſonage, and ſhall ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle a thing, which doth no real good, be ſo much accounted of, when it proceeds from vain Man whoſe breath is in his Noſtrils? Is not his favour to be more valued who is Lord of Lords, <hi>whoſe loving kindneſs is better then life,</hi> Pſal. 63. 3. For it reaches further. Certainly if we had faith, we ſhould not care to be rejected and deſpiſed of Men, as long as we have the aſſurance of that; no more then he who hath the Kings favour doth regard the eſteem of a common Beggar; God (who is not a Man that he ſhould lie) hath promiſed it to godly ſorrow and contrition; herein are thoſe ſayings found true. <hi>They that ſow in tears, ſhall reap in joy,</hi> Pſal. 126. 5. <hi>Bleſſed are ye that weep, for ye ſhall laugh.

A lively faith ſees into the other World, and over looks this: It gives a tranſitory glance, but not ſixes on periſhing things, and then they are no diſturbance: Experience aſſures we muſt be certainly deprived of them, as we daily ſee others are a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Our profeſſion teacheth to draw off our deſires before we are utterly taken from them; to be in, not of, rather above the World, juſt ſet the hand to thoſe little concernments here, but to have the affection ſtill on things above; and then the Man hath not much of Worldly Sorrow for his Portion, though he hath ſome (for as he partakes of the corruption, ſo muſt he of the curſe of his Fore-Father, which alſo in a great meaſure is taken away by Chriſt) yet he is comforted by Gods Grace, that he is very well able to bear. <hi>Many are the afflictions of the Righteous: but the Lord delivereth them out of all,</hi> Pſal. 34. 19.

It is alledged, they do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn or ſpeak againſt the good Actions of others, but their way of doing; they cannot approve of that forward indiſcreet zeal (it is their own Phraſe) and making ſo great Pretences in the Eye of the World; for ſay they, Men may be good <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and yet not ſeem ſo outwardly.</p>
               <p>If it were ſufficient to be a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> only within, this would take away the Crown from the Martyrs, and accuſe them of Folly, for according to this ſuppoſal they might have believed on Chriſt, and have kept their Faith to themſelves, and ſo have eſcaped cruel Torments and Death. But this they did not, knowing what
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:46484:68"/> was written, <hi>Mat. 10. 32, 33. Rom.</hi> 10. 9, 10. 'Tis replyed, the Caſe now is altered, We do not live amongſt Heathens, but in a Chriſtian Countrey: it is taken for granted, that every one believes Jeſus to be the Son of God, what need of ſo much Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion?

What mean thoſe bitter Words and Railings, Witty Jeſts and Drolls againſt thoſe, who are careful to ſerve God in ſincerity, but to diſcourage and make them aſhamed of ſo doing? This hath been the uſual Practiſe of the World; the Prophet doth arm thoſe of his own and ſucceeding times. <hi>Hearken unto me, ye that know righteouſneſs, the People in whoſe heart is my Law,</hi> (this is a peculiar manner of expreſſing Gods Sincere and faithful Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants) <hi>Fear ye not the reproach of men, neither be ye afraid of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilings,</hi> Iſa. 51. 7.

It is ſaid Words indefinitely, and therefore extends to his Doctrine and Commandments; and ſo it is not called <hi>Jewiſh</hi> or <hi>Heathen,</hi> but the ſame Character which belongs to our preſent Age. He is aſhamed or afraid of his Religion, that will not own it. If he ſhrinks back, and would not be thought Godly when he is ſo ſecretly, this proceeds from Pride and ſinful Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty.

None ſhould refrain from doing good, becauſe others may come to bear of it; no more then forſake the aſſembling of our ſelves together, becauſe others ſee us go to Church. Neither (as the manner of ſome) is this to be done only on the Lords-day, but as we have oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity on every day, for ſo they did in the firſt Ages of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, <hi>Luke 24. 53.

However ſtrange or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe it ſeems now to go to publick Worſhip on a Week<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> day, it was as unuſual then to neglect it. Who conſiders the Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion we ſtand in towards the Great God of the World, muſt think it a reaſonable Service to pay our Homage, and Praiſe him from every riſing of the Sun, unto the going down thereof. Nor are we to avoid good and edifying Diſcourſe, becauſe that will be likewiſe heard, but the Obligation is greater, from <hi>Pſal. 37. 30, 31. Mat.</hi> 12. 34, 35. If the heart be good, good things will come forth. God alone is the diſcerner of the Thoughts, and they do not appear, yet Words and Actions will.

Mat.</hi> 12. 16, 18, 19. againſt making too much outward ſhew; There is a good and middle way, between too much Affectation on the one hand, ſinful Shame and Lukewarmneſs on the other: Both extreams are to be avoided, but indeed the firſt is ſafe, if the heart be ſincere, throughly purged from all Hypocriſie and Pride. It is much better to be too zealous, (if that can be, for there are no limits ſet in Scripture) then of a careleſs and indifferent Temper; for that is always ſpoken againſt. <hi>But it is good to be zealouſly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected always in a good thing,</hi> Gal. 4. 18. And if out of a good intention, God knows the unfeigned love in the heart, from whence it proceeds, and ſo may approve thereof: So there is no ſuch Reaſon, why that, which is called a forward indiſcreet Zeal, ſhould be hated and ſpoken againſt. Every thing, which doth exceed the ordinary and faſhionable Godlineſs of the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, is termed ſo. We have ſeen that of our Saviour fulfilled,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:46484:69"/> 
                  <hi>Becauſe iniquity ſhall abound, the love of many ſhall wax cold,</hi> Mat. 24. 12. The judgment of God being different from that of Men, perhaps he may judge that to be true and prudent, which they thus call. Thoſe Opinions and Excuſes in Religion which are vulgarly received, are as commonly falſe. But admit ſome were over Zealous, Yet <hi>Charity envieth not, thinketh no evil, believeth all things, hopeth all things,</hi> 1 Cor. 13. 4, 5, 7. And here will make a good Conſtruction, that ſuch is well meaning, and therefore this takes off from prejudice and evil ſurmizings againſt him. If ſome are more diligent in the Worſhip and Service of God, we ought the more to rejoyce, and glorifie God on his behalf. But to hate a Man for no other cauſe but his well-doing, is not what all, but only the worſe ſort of wicked do. Neither do thou too raſhly condemn thy poor Brother, for whom Chriſt died, of Superſtition, (that hath been ſo termed, which in the Language of the Holy Ghoſt is to <hi>fear the Lord greatly,</hi> 1 Kings 18. 3.) But how knoweſt thou his heart? It may be he doth what is Commanded, or thinks to be plainly inferred from the Word: If he is miſtaken, thou art rather to rightly inſtruct, then malign or envy him; but in no wiſe to laugh and make ſport; that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be juſtified on Fellow-<hi>Chriſtians.</hi> It is ſufficient to bear Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach from thoſe without, but it is more grievous when it comes from the ſame Houſhold of Faith.

Said our Lord to his Diſciples and Followers, which hath been ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled to a Witneſs. Some have pretended for God and his Chriſt, and their Sword hath made many Fatherleſs and Widows, have after the moſt ſtrange manner tormented to Death Women and Children, ript up Infants out of the Mothers Belly, ſhed the Blood of the Saints like water throughout Chriſtendom. All this, and more hath been done by thoſe, who in their own Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion <note place="margin">Luke 9. 55.</note> were zealous for the Prince of Peace; He came to ſave mens
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:46484:69"/> lives, but theſe have made it their buſineſs to kill and deſtroy. The Diſciples were reproved concerning the <hi>Samaritans, Ye know not of what Spirit ye are of,</hi> which plainly manifeſted, that he allowed not of the murder of Men, though for his own Honour, the beſt of ends. His whole Goſpel Commands Love, Peace, Gentleneſs, Meekneſs, and forbids whatever is contrary to them. But this Doctrine hath been concealed from ſome, who have given up themſelves to blind Teachers, thoſe Sanguinary Prieſts and Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites; they have obtruded the Doctrine of Devils, for that of the Holy Jeſus; and have put off for the Commandments of Chriſt, the Dictates of their Blood-thirſty minds. The ſilly People laden with Sins (and perhaps willing to make Atonement by murdering of <hi>Hereticks,</hi> which did increaſe their Guilt by ſlaying the Lords Heritage) were taught, ignorance makes the better <hi>Chriſtians:</hi> They might have ſo much uſed their own natural Reaſon, as to have conſidered, that Chriſt's Laws cannot be obeyed unleſs they are known, and therefore they muſt ſearch the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, which he Commands, <hi>John</hi> 5. 39. to ſee what they are, or have them from honeſt Teachers. But if they had done the firſt, they would have found <hi>Miniſters of Satan transformed as the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of Righteouſneſs,</hi> 2 Cor. 11. 15. And they would have known them by this kind of Suggeſtions, which come from none but the Deſtroyer; for what ſeems hateful and cruel to us as we are Men, can never be thought to have been delivered by him, who came into the World to perfect, not deprave Humane Nature. The many ſad Effects of wilde deſtructive Zeal, have proceeded from their wilful Ignorance of the Law he gave us, for they had been all prevented, if Men had only acted according to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections of the New Teſtament.</p>
               <p>Some on the other hand have read the Scriptures; but through miſ-interpretation, or rather wilful perverting ſome places of the Old Teſtament, have cryed up Zeal for the Lord of Hoſts, have rebelled againſt, and even killed the Lords anointed on this wicked Pretence. He re<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> again the Teachers of the People did cauſe them to err: But ſuppoſe the utmoſt ſhould be granted, they did counted for, (which yet is not) That Rebellion was lawful to the <hi>Je<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

No Zeal is according to the Goſpel, which ſtirs up to Sedition and Rebellion: If we would have it approved by God, it muſt be ordered according to the Rules laid down there, otherwiſe it is Sin and Madneſs.</p>
               <p>There is another miſtake concerning Zeal, of thoſe who pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually obſerve their own Traditions, and are very exact in pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Tythe of Mint, Aniſe and Cummin, but omitted the weightier Matters of the Law, Judgment, Mercy and Faith, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. 23. Thus did the <hi>Phariſees</hi> of old: And whether ſome of late have not been more zealous for a Ceremony, then Holineſs and the Love of God, their own Conſcience knows, and their Actions have diſcovered.

               <p>Hope is a right Application of the Promiſes in Scripture unto <note place="margin">Of Hope.</note> our ſelves.

If himſelf ſhould

The error of moſt Men is, they will exclaim horribly againſt deſpair (which indeed is a ſad thing) and will take all imaginable heed of not falling into it, but then they paſs over the ſure and middle way as if this were too near it, and ſo fall upon another more dangerous Rock, which (they going on ſecurely without noiſe,) proves deſtructive to thouſands; I mean preſumption on Gods mercy where is no ground for it. What doth it help the Ship toſſed to and fro, to caſt out Anchor where is no bottom to fix on? When the ſoul is troubled, what real good doth it to let out hope, if there is no promiſe to ſtay it ſelf on? Or if he thinks he can, yet heed muſt be taken that it be not falſly apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for that would be like fooliſh Pilots, who fancy they ſee the Shore, and make towards it, when it is quickſands, in which they coming near are Swallowed. Alas! juſt upon ſinking they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the deceit, but if they had before, they had avoided it; The Sinner dropping into the bottomleſs Pit, then is fully ſenſible of the falſeneſs of all his former hopes, but if he had been ſo wiſe in the day of Salvation, to have truſted unto them no further then they were to be made true and ſtedfaſt out of the Word, he had never came to this. Then perhaps Satan (working with all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivableneſs in them that periſh) might beat off from examining themſelves throughly, repreſenting ſuch thoughts as Melancholy Fancies, tending to deſpair, which they muſt drive out of their mind. But they ſhould conſider whether ſuch do neceſſarily ariſe from Scripture, for by that all muſt be judged at the laſt day. <hi>And if we would judge our ſelves, we ſhould not be judged,</hi> 1 Cor. 11. 31.

And whether they do or not, private Perſons are made Judges; and if they think ſuch an one doth not, Subjects may lawfully diſobey and rebel againſt him. If this ſhould be granted, No King howſoever good or righteous would be ſafe in his Perſon; for ſo apt are Men in judging the

If he was another <hi>David,</hi> a man after Gods own heart (why he was hated and ſpoken againſt) he would not be after their liking. Then they would not have this Man reign over them; they will outwardly conclude him to be an Enemy to Jeſus, and pronounce it as lawful to deſtroy him as Bears and Wolves. Whether he is ſo or not, an uncharitable Opinion or falſe Accuſation is ſufficient ground with them to kill the Lords Anointed, againſt whom none could lift up his hand and be guiltleſs.

The Taſte of pleaſant Liquors periſhes in the draught, and afterwards ſeems as if not received in; but if the immoderate uſe makes an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration in the Man, it is a drunken fit, and the utmoſt good which ariſes from that, is to be examined in another place.

Laſtly, what is reckoned worth all, abundance of Gold and Silver; This doth ſerve only for the procurement of the things ſpoken of, and if they do not afford a true Happineſs, much leſs will the other.

<pb n="158" facs="tcp:46484:88"/> be no more. How ſoon we may be there, we know not; but moſt certainly we ſhall be there at laſt. <hi>Take ye heed, Watch and Pray, for ye know not when the time is,</hi> Mark 13. 33. Who will not obey this Commandment, but be unmindful, go to ſleep and take their reſt, yet <hi>their Damnation ſlumbereth not;</hi> and if they put the evil day far from them, yet ſtill <hi>their condemnation lingereth not;</hi> and that will come do what they can. In the days of <hi>Sodom</hi> they did Marry and were given in Marriage, did not at all conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the things which ſhould come upon them; nevertheleſs the Lord rained down Fire and Brimſtone. What are now become of all thoſe in the Generation with <hi>Amos,</hi> who would put the evil day far from them? Yet it is long ſince come, and they could not ſtave it off. Thoſe of the ſame mind in the time of our <note place="margin">Amos 6.</note> Fathers are all gone; and their careleſneſs could not preſerve them from the Pit of Deſtruction: They thought the very like what ſome do now, the things of another World were at a great diſtance and they need not mind them, yet they fell in unawares. We can no more think their miſery leſs, then who wilfully ſhut their Eyes and drop into a bottomleſs Gulph, whereas if they had kept them open, they might have ſeen and paſſed by it. <hi>Like the evil Servant who ſaid in his heart, My Lord delayeth his coming,</hi> Mat. 24. 48. They had time enough and to ſpare on the Earth, therefore they would ſmite and oppreſs their Neighbours, eat and drink with the drunken. But the Lord came in a day when they looked not for him, and they are reſerved unto his juſt Judgment; if they might riſe from the dead again and have ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther day of grace and for bearance, they would be other kind of Men: They would take heed and not be ſurprized on a ſudden. But the decrees of Almighty God like himſelf are unchangeable, they were told of this before, and they might have accepted the good counſel of the Lord Jeſus; and therefore he is Righteous in his dealings towards Men. Who dyed in their ſins have no more place for repentance, for <hi>he gave them a ſpace to repent, and they repented not,</hi> Rev. 2. 21. But the living may as we are at this day, yet not better then our Fathers, we muſt ſhortly dye in like manner, and are to ſtand or fall to our own Maſter. We ſhall ſee another repreſentation of things then is now before us, one which openeth into the eternal Countrys, either <hi>new Heavens and a new Earth wherein dwelleth Righteouſneſs,</hi> 2 Pet. 3. 13. Or a Land of Darkneſs, of the ſhadow of Death, a
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:46484:88"/> place of Dragons and Scorpions, the inhabitation of Sin and Miſery.</p>
               <p>Yet a little while, and we ſhall be removed out of this place, and then we ſhall find that the things here ſpoken of (though they may at preſent <hi>ſeem as idle tales,</hi> Luke 24. 11.) will be real, and no fictions. Whoſoever believeth that God is true, and that thoſe things are ſo which he hath ſpoken by his holy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, Son and Apoſtles, cannot otherwiſe then be convinced of the certainty of them even now. If ſo, nothing can be more effectual to perſwade: Men futurity will be no more an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt them, then now it is againſt Mens going a Voyage to a Foreign Country, where it is ſeveral Months before they can reap any profit. The ſhortneſs of the time before, at leaſt by Death, the infallibility of that, the exceeding greatneſs of the concern ſhould take away all other diſadvantages; If we had but faith as a grain of Muſtard-ſeed, we ſhould remove Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains which now hinder us to behold <hi>the Land that is very far off,</hi> Iſa. 33. 17. And for all the diſtance it would more affect us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of its exceeding pleaſantneſs, then that our feet now tread on; if it doth not, it cometh to paſs becauſe of unbelief. <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs if we believe not, yet he abideth faithful, he cannot deny himſelf,</hi> 2 Tim. 2. 13. <hi>He hath provided a reſt for his people, and to whom ſware he that they ſhould not enter into his reſt, but to them that believed not?</hi> Heb. 3. 18. They ſhall not only be deprived of that, but <hi>ſhall have their part in the Lake which burneth with Fire and Brimſtone, which is the ſecond Death,</hi> Rev. 21. 8. Which they may as ſoon avoid by ſaying they do not believe any ſuch thing, as now they may a temporal evil by fancying ſtrongly it ſhall not come upon them.

So let all the world ſay to the contrary, it ſignifieth not: The word he hath ſpoken ſhall ſtand, and he will do according to it, let all mankind diſpute or think what they will. If they will not believe, they muſt periſh in their unbelief; if they do that, but will not give heed to obey the truth thereof, they alſo ſhall be puniſhed from the preſence of the Lord and from the glory of his power. Both theſe are follies ſo great that there wants a name to expreſs them, yet this laſt ſeems to be greateſt, for there are in Scripture ſuch forcible arguments to obedience, that who believes muſt be as abſolute a fool or madman if they do not work upon him, as he who refuſes a great Eſtate when offered, or run him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into a fire when he may paſs by and avoid it.</p>

But further Gods ſpecial providence is over his own People, and more particularly over his Anointed. <hi>It is he that giveth Salvation unto Kings,</hi> Pſal. 144. 10. Not that all good Kings have always temporal deliverances, for there is the example of <hi>Joſiah,</hi> who had that excellent Character, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 23. 25.

Let the King be aſſured that if he cleaves
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:46484:90"/> unto God with his whole heart, and puts away Idolatry and falſe Worſhip, he ſhall have Temporal or Eternal Salvation; that moſt commonly, this moſt certainly, but rather both. It is ſo well pleaſing unto God when thoſe obey him whom he hath placed in the higheſt Room on Earth, that he rewards them here and hereafter. To rule according to Gods Commandments is the moſt ſafe way to preſerve them in the Royal Seat of their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors. <hi>In mercy ſhall the Throne be eſtabliſhed, and he ſhall ſit upon it in Truth, in the Tabernacle of</hi> David, <hi>judging and ſeeking judgment and hasting Righteouſneſs,</hi> Iſa. 16. 5. <hi>Did not thy Father Eat and Drink, and do Judgment and Juſtice, and then it was well with him, be judged the cauſe of the Poor and Needy, then it was well with him, was not this to know me ſaith the Lord?</hi> Jer. 22. 16. Every one that hath but the common ſence of humanity muſt love, honour and obey him; and theſe will be ſuch a ſafe-guard to his perſon, that thoſe his implacable Enemies, whom no goodneſs can overcome will be forced to lick the duſt; <hi>for a Good man ſome would even dare to die,</hi> Rom. 5. 7. But for preſervation of a good King, thouſands will venture their lives, and undergo the greateſt extremity. He is happy in the good-will and affection of his Subjects, they will rejoyce and praiſe God on his behalf, to ſee him alſo zealous for his glory; that he would ſuffer all Godly and Faithful Miniſters, that a ſtop may be put to that torrent of iniquity, which is a vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation to behold. <hi>In his dayes ſhall the Righteous flouriſh, and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of peace ſo long as the Moon endureth. Prayer alſo ſhall be mane continually for him, and daily ſhall he be praiſed,</hi> Pſal. 72. 4, 7, 15. The Common-wealth will be then happy, when Kings are Chriſtians, not in name or title, but when they live and govern according to the Rules of the Goſpel. When they are Obedient to God, diligent in his Worſhip and Ordinances, exerciſe all manner of Righteouſneſs and Juſtice towards their people, and themſelves obſerve Temperance and Sobriety; and ſo manage all their Actions as Men that indeed look for a Judgment to come. There is an excellent Scheme laid down better then that of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent or Modern Polititians (which ſtands in no need of them, for it hath Providence and Wiſdom from above) and will make a Prince renowned for all Ages. It will give him ſatisfaction of mind, that is, in beginning; for the utmoſt happineſs here is <hi>Light Sowen,</hi> Pſal. 97. 11.

               <p>I hope none of the Grandees of the Earth think otherwiſe, that Religion doth not thus much, but ſeems to them an under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuing of Majeſty, as rather calculated for low ſneaking, and not for noble Spirits. Leaſt any who term themſelves brave Souls ſhould ſay ſo in the heart, for they will not with the tongue for fear of betraying their own infidelity and ignorance, let this ſhort queſtion be put to them, the firſt words of the Creed, Whether they do believe in God?

God doth equally intend the Happineſs of all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and therefore that cannot be the proper one which is not given to all: For they are all of the ſame Frame and natural De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, Body and Soul alike, which would appear if they had the
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:46484:94"/> ſame Education and Circumſtances. That thoſe of upper Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition be not exalted above meaſure, let them know, There is not ſo much in Riches and Honour, as is commonly imagined. Gold, Pearls and coſtly Array are nothing of the Man himſelf; they neither came into the World with him, nor ſhall go out with him; and our ſelves would think it ridiculous, if we ſaw an Horſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult and puſh his Fellow as if not worthy to come near, becauſe the other hath a rich Saddle and fine Entrappings. Bare Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour is but Breath depending upon the Speaker, and when re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in may bloat up or burſt the Owner; but can never fill, or make him more Healthy. And though theſe Men are puffed up upon Account of other Priviledges, it might be manifeſted particularly what they are ſenſible of by Experience, that the trouble and diſcontent ariſing from them, will abundantly Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoiſe the ſeeming Good and Complacency. Beſides, that they are in no wiſe adequate to the Divine Soul of Man; for Senſual and Viſible things can never ſatisfie her which is of a different Nature, they are narrow and finite unable to fill her large Room and boundleſs Deſires. They may be juſt taken in, but do not throughly repleniſh the leaſt part thereof. And further they come from without, which may be ſtopped by ſeveral Accidents and hindred from within. If the Body is ſick, or there be Pain in the leaſt Member, all thoſe put together will not make Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation; nor can it be driven away, when the Patient will by all his Riches and Greatneſs. They cannot cure Grief and Vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of mind for common occaſions, much leſs <hi>the fears and thoughts of the World to come;</hi> for theſe are only to be allayed as hereafter ſhewed: But other kinds of Remedy are more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and in the end will prove longer tormenting, then preſent irkſomeneſs and diſquiet. Indeed unleſs thoſe are ordered aright, it will ſpoyl the Enjoyment of all; for do what he can, this thought will ever and anon recur, That he who is Lord of ſo many Acres, muſt be confined to ſuch a Compaſs of ground which is ſix Foot in length, and two in breadth, for <hi>Nobles ſhall dwell in the Duſt,</hi> Nahum 3. 18. It will not ſtay there, but go further; for who hath not heard of <hi>the Rich Man that died, and was buried,</hi> (there is ſomewhat worſe ſucceeds.) <hi>And in Hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments,</hi> Luke 16. 22, 23. If this which was ſpoken by Truth it ſelf, were duly conſidered of, it would make Great Men tremble, and live otherwiſe then they do; for
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:46484:94"/> we can ſee no Example of their manner of Life throughout the Goſpel, but in him, who went to Hell, and there is no other Reaſon aſſigned thereof but his voluptuous Living, and what may be gathered of uncharitableneſs. Too many now adays re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble him in both, giving not much more out of their great Poſſeſſions then a few Crumbs, which fall down of Courſe and according to Cuſtom. They had beſt take heed, that their end be not the ſame alſo. Who will go on in his way, and not think thereof now, yet then <hi>He will lift up his eyes,</hi> and conſider from whence he is fallen. It will be moſt afflicting to remember, that who had all things to pleaſe Fleſh and Blood, ſhould be tormented there; who ſwilled down delicious Wine in abundance, ſhould want a drop of Water to cool his Tongue.</p>
               <p>Be not frightned with this Severity of Words, for it is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to be fore-warned, though in the moſt terrible Characters, then ſuffer the Truth and Signification of them. If diligent care be not uſed to prevent this, it will take off from the Pleaſure of your Recreations and Paſtimes as they are called. Which are ſaid to be made uſe of to ſpend the time, as if that did not paſs away faſt enough of it ſelf: And it may ſeem ſtrange, that ſome ſhould ſo much endeavour to throw that away, when for ought they know (unleſs they repent and bring forth Fruits meet for Repentance) this is the only time of Comfort they will ever have, and therefore they ſhould make much of it, that it may appear long, but not contrariwiſe. Which is an intimation, that their Life, which they would have others think ſo Happy, yet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves do not find it; for <hi>they that count it Pleaſure to riot in the day time,</hi> 2 Pet. 2. 13. yet are more Solicitous to make it ſeem ſhort, then poor Day-labourers. At night they fall to the Works of Darkneſs, ſpend the greater part in Chambering and Wantonneſs. When it is time to awake out of ſleep, then they go to it, and reverſe Gods Ordinance of the night for Reſt. By not obſerving the words of his Law, the threatning is fulfilled now upon Earth, <hi>In the Morning thou ſhalt ſay, Would God it were even; and at even thou ſhalt ſay, Would God it were Morning, for the fear of thine heart wherewith thou ſhalt fear,</hi> Deut. 28 67. As is diſcovered by them, who cannot be one minute without Company, who in time of Health muſt have wax Candles burning all Night. In the day they make it their Buſineſs to ſtifle it more: And yet for all they would have time paſs away. Which is a manifeſt token of the
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:46484:95"/> Miſery of their preſent Condition, for none can deſire that, unleſs it be out of Expectation of a future and greater Bleſſedneſs; which they have no Proſpect of, being only for the preſent, and what is before them. If all this ſhould at length end in a ſad Eternity, there is no Stupefaction, nor making the leaſt part thereof to paſs away; and it will be ten thouſand times more Vexing, then that now in the days of their Fleſh. What can be ſaid too much to recover People out of this Condition? What kind of Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions ſhall be made uſe of to prevent others ſliding in, but the leaſt towards it? To you High and Rich, let this warning be given. Who are ſo deſirous after it, have a care of miſ-placing or ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a wrong way that Happineſs which is to be found in God only, and in the way he hath ſhewed; for there it is to be had, and no where elſe, <hi>For my People have Committed two Evils: They have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken me the Fountain of living Waters, and hewed them out Ciſterns, bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Ciſterns that can hold no Water,</hi> Jer. 2. 13. Who reſort to theſe, will be ſtill diſappointed of ſatisfying their Thirſt. Our gracious God in that he would the more effectually draw us unto himſelf, hath ſo provided that we cannot be otherwiſe Happy, but by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto him, and we muſt be neceſſarily miſerable if we do not.</p>
               <p>Man is a proud Worm, he will not ſtand beholden, no not to God for Happineſs, though he hath brought him into Being, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed him with thoſe means, by which he will try to attain it him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and his own way in oppoſition to that preſcribed unto him. 'Tis Riches and Honour, which lift him up to this height, he thinks them his own, and they can make him Happy, and what need he then be indebted to any?

Call to mind further, he doth not this becauſe he cannot do otherwiſe, for he hath ſeverity in ſtore as he will manifeſt upon thy ſelf if thou contemneſt his goodneſs; it cannot be, unleſs thou art guilty of the moſt horrible incivility that ever was, thou ſhouldſt refuſe to hearken when he calls thee; Thou mayeſt put off thy inferiours to a more convenient ſeaſon, and whom thou doſt not much care for; but God is the excellent one in all the World, who daily poureth his benefits on thee, hath given all thou haſt, who holdeth thy Soul in life?

I know ye are Chriſtians, and ye do believe them; Why then will you not be moved to flee from the wrath to come? If you are impeached of High Treaſon againſt your Sovereign, you will uſe all endeavours not to be found guilty; and if you are, you will uſe no means unattempted to procure a Pardon.

Indeed <hi>he waits to be gracious,</hi> but it is to thoſe who come unto him, and if you will not (to ſpeak in the gentile dialect) you may chooſe and be damned. Our ſelves would take it ill, if we ſhould at great coſt or pains get a Pardon for a Servant, and he out of peeviſh pride or negligence would refuſe it; Now this Chriſt hath done, he hath purchaſed you with his own Blood, but you muſt ſue it our your ſelves, or go without it. A condemned Criminal here is dealt bountifully withal, if his life be ſpared only; but the goodneſs of God en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dureth yet daily, and infinitely exceeds that of Creatures.

When many times they do not long enjoy their lands, for theſe change owners and ſeldom continue in the ſame Family for two or three hundred years, much leſs for ever.

They are, whether they think of it or not, Strangers and Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims on Earth as their Fathers were. So the preſent Condition is not to be accounted of, for it is nothing in Compariſon of what ſhall ſucceed, and therefore it ſhould be ones whole buſineſs to neglect this, and do all things to ſecure a future Happineſs, for this in a ſhort time will be done away, and ſeem all one as if it had never been. Even at this inſtant it may be obſerved, all former things are gone as a ſhadow that departeth; nothing remains but a faint remembrance, which doth not yield the leaſt Pleaſure, but rather Anguiſh: We preſs nearer to the things which are not ſeen, but eternal Refreſhment or Miſery. If one Man was to ſuffer all that could be laid on him in this World, and to come to Heaven at laſt, he is no more to be pitied then that common Labourer, who doth but his ordinary Days-work, and hath an hundred Pounds for his Reward: So again, if ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did enjoy all the Honours and Pleaſures that were to be had, ſpent forty or ſixty Years in the greateſt Mirth without intermix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of trouble or wearineſs, (as none ever did) all would not be a Compenſation for the firſt hour in Hell.

<pb n="182" facs="tcp:46484:100"/> and Hardſhip were to be laid on us, as long as hereby we ſhall come to receive an infinite good through the Gift of God, and avoid a like inconvenience. If inſtead of a Barren and dry Wilderneſs, we were to march through a fiery Furnace to the Heavenly <hi>Canaan;</hi> if inſtead of having Proſperity mingled with Adverſity, all the days of our Pilgrimage were to be continually evil; If inſtead of denying Luſts, we were abſolutely Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to cut off our right Hand and pluck out the right Eye, and to do violence to the leaſt natural Inclination; yet conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Greatneſs of the Joy and Sorrow ſet before us, theſe would have been moſt equal Terms, if it had pleaſed the <hi>Great Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver (who is able both to ſave and deſtroy)</hi> to have given them.

But ſo gracious hath been our God (Break forth into ſinging all ye In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of the Earth, and Praiſe his Name, which you can never do ſo much as this Love deſerves) to lay no more upon us, then what is ſummed up, <hi>Deut. 10. 12, 13. And now Iſrael, what doth the Lord thy God require of thee, but to fear the Lord thy God, to walk in all his ways, and to love him, and to ſerve the Lord thy God with all thy Heart, and with all thy Soul, To keep the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of the Lord and his Statutes, which I command thee this day for thy good?</hi> Which are contrived to make us as Happy in this Life, as is poſſible for us to be. And though this had been ſufficient requital of it ſelf; yet further throughout his Holy Word is manifeſted eternal Life. <hi>Do this and live,</hi> under which was more comprehended then barely living here, for Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors did ſo. This hath been more clearly made known by him who came ſince; who hath brought Grace and Truth along with him, <hi>Who came not to deſtroy the Law, but to fulfil it,</hi> and make it yet more for our Good; for albeit the <hi>Jews</hi> by reaſon of the Carnality of their Hearts were allowed a more free Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the things of this Life, then we are now under the Goſpel, which is upon better Promiſes: The intent whereof is to <hi>Cleanſe our ſelves from all Filthineſs of Fleſh and Spirit, and to perfect Holineſs in the fear of God,</hi> 2 Cor. 7. 1. So that Senſual Enjoyments are contrary to the Nature of our Holy Calling.

And as the Diſciples asked our Lord upon that Saying, <hi>Who then can be ſaved?</hi> So if this were allowed, the queſtion may be reverſed; Who then would Periſh? For who is it that follows the Faſhion in Clothes, Behaviour and manner of Living, and doth it not in Religion alſo? We are ſure God ſpake by his Son, and therefore that is truth which he ſaith; as for this Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion it is contrary to his Doctrine, and we know not who was the firſt Author of it, unleſs it came from him, who ſetteth up his Kingdom againſt that of Chriſt, whoſe Employment it is to beguile Souls, the old Serpent, the Father of Lyes.

<pb n="186" facs="tcp:46484:102"/> This <hi>Peter</hi> teacheth plainly, <hi>Foraſmuch then as Chriſt hath ſuffered for us in the Fleſh, arm your ſelves likewiſe with the ſame mind; for he that hath ſuffered in the Fleſh, hath ceaſed from Sin, That he no longer ſhould live the reſt of his time in the Fleſh to the Luſts of Men, but to the Will of God: for the time paſt of our Life may ſuffice us of have wrought the Will of the Gentiles, when we walked in Laſciviouſneſs, Luſts, Exceſs of Wine, Revellings, and abominable Idolatries,</hi> 1 Pet. 4. 1, 2, 3. An exact Pourtraiture of our times, for though the laſt may ſeem to have been ſomewhat ceaſed among us, yet <hi>whoſe God is his Belly,</hi> or <hi>who ſaith unto Gold, Thou art my Confidence,</hi> is alſo an abominable Idolater: Saith another Apoſtle, <hi>Walk in the Spirit, and ye ſhall not fulfil the Luſt of the Fleſh, for the Fleſh Luſteth againſt the Spirit, and the Spirit againſt the Fleſh, and theſe are contrary one to the other,</hi> Gal. 5. 16, 17. And the works of the Fleſh are reckoned up further, ſome of which are eſteemed neceſſary Qualities of a Perſon of worth and briskneſs, and the Fruits of the Spirit are thought fit only for dull, ſneaking, baſe born Souls; but not for them: So the Judgment of Gentlemen is contrary to the Goſpel. And that which would render one a meet Partaker for the inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance of the Saints in Light, is in no wiſe thought comely for thoſe of that Station. <hi>This I ſay therefore, and teſtifie in the Lord, that ye henceforth walk not as other Gentiles walk in the Vanity of their mind. Having the underſtanding darkned, being alienated from the Life of God, through the ignorance that is in them, becauſe of the Blindneſs of their Heart,</hi> (as to ſaving and ſpiritual knowledge, for otherwiſe they are quick-ſighted enough) <hi>Who being paſt feeling have given themſelves over unto Laſciviouſneſs, to work all uncleanneſs with Greedineſs. But ye have not ſo learned Chriſt,</hi> Eph. 4. 17, 18, 19, 20. Let any compare theſe places, and ſeveral others in the New Teſtament with the preſent Faſhion, and then Judge; Whether true Chriſtianity and the modiſh Gentility are not as contrary and incompatible, as Light and Darkneſs? And though ſome Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſers, but not the Servants of Chriſt would fain reconcile im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible things; yet let none truſt to what they teach or ſay, for we are not to ſtand or fall according to their corrupt Gloſſes, but the ſecrets of all Hearts are to be judged by the Goſpel of Jeſus. Who will put his own Interpretation on his own Laws, and we are to receive from his month the Sentence of Life or Condemnation. Let none therefore be the more Confident, or preſume to go on in his Courſe, becauſe one whom he hath choſen for a guide, tells
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:46484:102"/> him, he is right enough, and he is willing to believe him; for ſuch can know no otherwiſe then by the Goſpel, and it is agreed on all hands, that thoſe Texts which are given to make wiſe unto Salvation, are ſo plain and eaſie to be underſtood that they need no Interpretation at all; and it cannot be that any, who come in ſincerity to be informed, ſhould be deceived in them. But thus it is, Men are ſtrangely given to their own Luſts; they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not endure to reſiſt the Allurement of ſenſual Pleaſures, and are not willing to bring down their haughty minds, and yet would partake of the Promiſes of the Goſpel, and avoid its Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings; ſo there muſt be an expedient found out to do all this. How ready are they to hearken unto, and embrace every propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal made to this end? Either by their own deceitful Hearts, or by him who works with all deceivableneſs in them that Periſh: Or ſome others have been found, who inſtead of <hi>ſhewing People</hi>

Who being willing to pleaſe their great Benefactors, do according as they would have, <hi>Speak ſmooth things and Propheſie deceits,</hi> Iſa. 30. 10. Who know no ſooner way to oblige them, then by dictating Doctrines ſutable to their ungodly Luſts and Inclinations; that they may live the Life of the wicked, and die the Death of the righteous; follow all iniquity here, and receive the Crown for Well-doing hereafter. And this is done by divulging ſome pleaſing (but wrong and miſ-applyed) Notions of Gods wonderful Mercy; of Faith in our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and relying wholly on him for Salvation; of a formal daily Repentance which is well enough, if more ſincere and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect on the Death-bed; the Doctrine of partial Obedience; of Deſires and Reſolutions (which are for the moſt part Mockery or Non-ſenſe) the miſtakes of Sins of infirmity, for the works of the Fleſh and unrighteouſneſs come under theſe; of diſtinguiſhing between the Counſels and Precepts of the Goſpel, ſtretching it further then they have Warrant from, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 25. What they have a mind to follow thoſe are the Commands, and what they have not is of the other ſort, and then they ſin not in neglecting it. And ſuch like. Out of which may be patched up a fine ſort of Divinity to pleaſe the Great Ones here, by giving them Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement, that after they have gratified to the utmoſt all their

But one would think ſome did not ſo much, or what is worſe, <hi>Think that the God-head was like unto Gold or Silver, or ſtone graven by Art and Mans device,</hi> Acts 17. 29. for they would ſtamp their own Impreſſions, and more derogate from his Glory, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe him in their own imaginations then they did, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 23. for theſe would make God ſuch an one as they would have him, render him a Lyar, alter and change his very Nature, beſeech him to determine his everlaſting Goſpel, rather then he ſhall not ſave them.

He left his Word behind to try the Doctrines whether they be of Men or no, by which he will judge the World, and not by this or that Doctors Opinion: Let others now put what meaning they will upon the commands of Chriſt, yet if he ſhould interpret them otherwiſe, every one knoweth whoſe muſt be taken, and by which we are to abide.

If theſe and more places which do declare the ſtrictneſs of the Goſpel Precepts, were impartially weighed in the Spirit of our minds, not putting in the ballance againſt them fleſhly luſts or corrupt reaſon, How can we imagine a perfunctory and formal courſe of Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs (though it be never ſo much in vogue) will ever carry a Man to Heaven? for none can go thither who obeys not the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel.

Neither let any one therefore at preſent be fearful, leaſt when he hath run well, he ſhall not obtain, by reaſon of ſome ſence which God may put on his own Laws, which his poor Servant is not aware of; for God is not unfaithfull that he ſhould deceive any: and on what conditions the promiſe of Eternal Life is given, is ſo clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly delivered, that it is impoſſible any one who hath but common ſence ſhould be miſtaken as to them.

What pertains to this end is ſo clear and obvious, that they muſt be damnably wreſted, if any one do err herein; There is ſuch a wonderful agreement concerning the neceſſary things, and ſuch plainneſs of expreſſion, that none can be deceived, but he who hath a mind to be deceived; nor any be ignorant, but he that would be ignorant: ſo all are left without excuſe.</p>
               <p>Suffer your ſelves to be admoniſhed, who now <hi>walk according to the courſe of this World, among whom you have your converſation in the luſts of the fleſh, fulfilling the deſires of the fleſh, and of the mind,</hi> Eph. 2. 2, 3.

Do not look upon this as vain Words, for it is a certain truth; if you fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Multitude, you will not be among thoſe few in the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row way that leadeth unto life; and you muſt then be amongſt thoſe many of the other way.

If thou haſt not taken it upon thee, yet God will judge thee; and if thou haſt, it is a fearful thing to be a Lyar unto God.

               <p>But thou haſt a diſtinction to elude this, and all which hath been hitherto ſpoken, <hi>viz.</hi> The Pomp and Glory of the World there meant, and thoſe places in the New Teſtament afore-cited, refer only to the Idolatrous cuſtoms of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> at that time, and ſignifie nothing to thoſe of the preſent Age. This is apparently falſe, for in the generality of thoſe Texts, there is no mention made of Idolatrous Cuſtoms; but <hi>of Luſt, exceſs of Wine, exceſs of Riot, Revellings, Vanity of Mind;</hi> they are ſomewhat intended, but not only. A full Anſwer is given to all this from <hi>Acts 2. 39. The promiſe is unto you, and your Children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord our God ſhall call.</hi> And ſeeing Chriſt is to have a Church for all Generations to come, even to the end of the World; undoubtedly he deſigned the New Teſtament which is Sealed with his own Blood, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of force by his Death as a means for thoſe to believe on him,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:46484:105"/> and as a Law to govern their Manners, not only for thoſe which ſaw and heard him in the Fleſh; but for their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and Childrens Children, even to all poſterity for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more. It is further decreed that he ſhall judge the World by the Goſpel: Now if he ſhould (as moſt certainly he will) underſtand them according to the plain and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſence of the ſame Words; What then will become of thoſe who truſt unto this Objection? Which if admitted true would ſtrike at the Root of all Religion, and by further degrees baniſh it quite out of the World. But if here Men ſhould ſhake the fear of God from their minds, by cunning Evaſions, excuſe themſelves from the Obligation of his Commandments; yet they ſhall never eſcape that vengeance which now dogs them at the heels, and will be ſure to ſeize on them when out of this life: all their Sophiſtry will ſignifie nothing at all, when they come to appear before his Judgment-Seat. Though at preſent they are ſo pleaſed, if by a nice diſtinction they can ſave themſelves from the obedience of ſuch precepts; yet when he diſcovers the deceit they intended to put on him, and maketh them of none effect, How muſt they be confounded before Angels and Men at the laſt and terrible day? Indeed if we were to be judged by thoſe of like in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities with our ſelves, who know nothing of our thoughts, then there might be ſome hopes by crafty excuſes and ſubterfuges to palliate our caſe before them; but Seeing <hi>God hath appointed a day, in the which he will judge the World in Righteouſneſs, by that Man whom he hath ordained,</hi> Acts 17. 31. <hi>Who is the Power of God, and Wiſdom of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 1 24. <hi>Who will have all the Churches know, that I am he which ſearcheth the reins and hearts, Rev.</hi> 2. 23.

And then ſeveral, who think themſelves ſure enough at preſent, will be deceived in their Expectation. <hi>Many will ſay unto me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not propheſied in thy Name? and in thy Name caſt out Devils? And in thy Name done many won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Works? and then will I profeſs unto them I never knew you, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from me ye that work iniquity,</hi> Mat. 7. 22, 23. Every one is ſenſible there is no little Torment in a Worldly diſappointment, but in a thing of ſo great Moment it muſt be inexpreſſible

But <hi>the Word is nigh thee,</hi> which ſhews the way to the one or the other: They are both ſet before thee, Chooſe whether you will have. Never mind what others do. Every one is to bear his own burthen, and to give account of himſelf before God; What they do, what is that to thee? Look thou to thy ſelf, thou art more ſenſible of thine own Happineſs or Miſery then all the World beſides; it were better for thee that thou wert Happy and all Mankind beſides Miſerable, then that thou wert Miſerable, and all the reſt Happy. Whoſoever ſhall come to dwell with everlaſting Burnings, it will be but a poor mitigation that he had abundance of fellow ſufferers; When any one now is afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with violent pains of Stone or Strangury, it is but a ſmall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief to come and tell him that another perſon is tormented ſo as he is; nay, if thouſands were in the ſame manner, he had rather be at eaſe then to ſuffer with them, though they be of the greateſt Rank and Quality. I have heard of one, who in the time of Fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick and Madneſs, did ſay, he was for going to Hell, becauſe he ſhould have his eſteemed good Company there; but none can ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly conſider and determine ſo, and if God ſhould take him at
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:46484:106"/> his word, he would ever repent his folly; If he could have it for wiſhing, he would be out of their company, and be contented with all his heart to wander alone (as the Saints have done here for a ſmall time in Dens and Caves of the Earth) for all Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Neither let him think his condition will be good enough, becauſe he ſhall fare as well as the moſt, for the dregs of the Cup of Gods Wrath will not be leſs bitter, the more are to ſuck them out. Who is he that will ſtick to his old Companions in the day of their Temporal Adverſity, if thereby he ſhall involve himſelf in the ſame? Such indeed (though one of a thouſand) may be found, for there is hopes of getting out again; but what Man in his right wits would plunge himſelf into a bottomleſs Pit, from whence it is impoſſible ever to recover himſelf, only to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify ſome Friends? Friends did I call them, who are more ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natured then thoſe in Hell; <hi>for the Rich Man did pray that ſome one might be ſent to his Fathers Houſe, for he had five Brethren, that</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Luke 16.</note> 
                  <hi>he may teſtifie unto them, leaſt they alſo come to this place of Torment.</hi> He did not imagine it would be any ſatisfaction to have the more company there; and if ſome now in the fleſh are of a worſe diſpoſition to require ſuch an unreaſonable thing, it can be no incivility to deny them. They are Fiends and Devils in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnate; What good breeding can it be to oblige ſuch, who are willing to bring others under the ſame condemnation with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves? O come not thou into their ſecret, unto their aſſembly let not thine honour be united, <hi>My Son if Sinners entice thee, conſent thou not, ſurely in vain the net is ſpread in ſight of any Bird, and they lay wait for their own blood, they lurk privily for their own lives,</hi> Prov. 1. 10, 17, 18. If thou comeſt in among them, thon wilt endanger thine own alſo. <hi>Enter not into the path of the wicked, and go not into the way of evil Men,</hi> Prov. 4. 14, 15.</p>
               <p>It hath been one of the chief policies of <hi>Satan</hi> to work ſin into the Faſhion, that being the ſtanding rule of great Mens Actions; for they are not ſo much led away with Reaſon, as with Cuſtom, they muſt do what others of like quality do, they had rather err with them then be in the right way by themſelves. But they do not attend, that this is <hi>like natural brute Beasts made to be taken and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, and ſhall utterly periſh in their own corruption,</hi> 2 Pet. 2. 12. For in the mean while they follow the drove, not knowing whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they go. As Sheep or Oxen going together to Slaughter, they paſs along upon the Road not thinking of the ſhambles till
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:46484:107"/> they come to them, and then they will give back, but are forced in. Who are hurrying in the way to Death and Hell, when they come near the firſt, they wiſh they had not walked in ſuch a way, but in vain; Time paſt cannot be recalled in a thought, neither will a deſire at laſt gaſp be accepted for a well ſpent life. Had you not better conſider before hand, and turn aſide from the vain and ſinful cuſtoms of the People? It will not be a ſufficient exchange for the loſs of Preſent and Eternal Happineſs, to be a little puft up with following the humours of the Majority. If thou wilt renounce their evil wayes, another may do after thy Example, and then a third, and ſo the greater part may come to ſerve and obey the Lord, and then the Faſhion would be of that ſide. I am confident there are the inward wiſhes of many to this; What a bleſſed World would this be? In a brave and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble attempt every one ſhould try to be the leading Man, but now <hi>in theſe days the Kingdom of Heaven ſuffereth violence, and the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent take is by force;</hi> and to aſcend up into the City of the living God, is a more Glorious Enterprize, then to ſcale the Walls of the ſtrongeſt Fort in the whole Earth, yet none ſets forward in this Warfare. Some may be ſeen to follow afar off, but every one takes heed of being foremoſt; The chief of the People do ſlink, and come moſt behind: They do not care to march in the firſt Rank next to the Captain of our Salvation, nor yet to Encourage others. How vaſtly different are Mens Actions in reference to Heavenly, and the things of this World? Every one that is not a down-right unbeliever muſt acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that they are greater then theſe, yet how Cold and Slug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſh are our affections to the better part? How warm and lively after theſe which ſhall fail from us? as we ſee they have done, and do daily vaniſh from others. Either the Poſſeſſions are taken from the Owners, or the Owners are ſnatched from their Poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. If the things of God were duly conſidered, they would be as much practiſed and univerſally eſteemed as thoſe trifles and bubbles (things of no ſubſtance, and yet of ſhort continuance) which the Devil offers to beguil Men of a Kingdom. Pride and Luſt are ſo eſtabliſhed in the World, that there is no removing of them, otherwiſe then by the Grace of God; which will effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally do it, where it is received. There is hope yet, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Folly and Degeneracy of the greater part of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, that as ſome <hi>have eſcaped the Corruption that is in the World
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:46484:107"/> through Luſt,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 14. Others whom God ſhall bring to Faith and Knowledge, will do the like: The Lord add to the number of them, that ſin and iniquity may looſe ground, obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and righteouſneſs may increaſe and flouriſh in the Earth. But if this were as univerſally practiſed as the other, how would be ſeen the Tryal and Excellency thereof, for then People would <note place="margin">See Pſ. 66. 3, and Iſa. 60. 14.</note> follow after it for the ſame Reaſon, without intention to pleaſe and Good-will towards God, as now they do not come up to that degree which is required thereof. To do but what is common, and others do the ſame, there is no thanks nor reward for that, <hi>Mat. 5. 46. Luke</hi> 6. 33. If there was no oppoſition, there could be no Vertue. And if good things were highly eſteemed among Men, how ſhould we know whether any one would endure Shame and Reproach for them? <hi>Many of the chief Rulers believed on Chriſt, but would not confeſs him, for they loved the praiſe of Men more then the praiſe of God,</hi> John 12. 42, 43. And even now ſeveral Perſons of note and quality have a good liking to his Doctrine and Commandments, and would live more exactly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to them, if it were not for leſſening their Reputation and Eſteem in the World.</p>
               <p>But let theſe conſider, Mark 8. 34, 35, 36, 37, 38. <hi>He that loveth Father or Mother more then me, is not worthy of me,</hi> Mat. 10. 37. So neither can he be thought worthy of him, who loves his own Honour more then him. <hi>How can ye believe, which receive Honour one of another?</hi> John 5. 44. And though Honour is ſuch a precious thing through the innate Pride of our Hearts, that we can more eaſily part with dear Life it ſelf; yet he requires both, when thereby he is to be glorified and obeyed, <hi>Here is the Faith and Patience of the Saints,</hi> Here is the difficulty of a Chriſtian, to forſake beloved Luſts, which are as dear as his right Eye; to part with Honour which is more precious then his own Hearts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blood, when our Lord requires it. This makes it hard for a rich Man to be ſaved. A threefold Temptation doth beſet him from the Luſt of the Fleſh, the Luſt of the Eyes, and the Pride of Life. Though all are very apt to ſeduce him from the obedience and love of God, yet the laſt to ſome is of greater force then the reſt; for there be which can contemn their abundance, uſe, but not truſt in it; Who being of a knowing Temper can forſake Pleaſures; but Honour and Reputation they cannot, at leaſt will not give up. They do all things to advance it, whether ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:46484:108"/> or not, is no Conſideration, or no hindrance: They refrain from doing that, which the Law of God and the dictate of their own minds prompt unto, if they once think they ſhall loſe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of their Eſteem. To make a ſincere and honeſt Profeſſion of Godlineſs is not Faſhionable in this crooked and perverſe Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration; and therefore though they may well approve of it, they will be ſure to keep it within, and not diſcover it by a ſuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Converſation. The Apoſtolical rule is, <hi>Whatſoever ye do, do all to the Glory of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 10. 31. but theſe conſult their own to the neglect of that. This is a diſtinct Principle of Action, which not only makes it ſelf equal, but exalts it ſelf above the Will of God, for by that they are guided, and if led to any thing contrary to the other, they conſent unto it, and put him off with a, Good Lord pardon me. They lightly regard the Law of the Moſt High, and think to come off with a Complemental Ejacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. In Honour they prefer themſelves before him, and yet vainly dream to pacifie him with a few words of Courſe: For which of you would be thus ſerved? If your own Servants ſhould refuſe to do ſuch Commandments of yours, becauſe they thought it an under-valuing, and they ſhould loſe their Credit among their Fellow-Servants; what would you do to ſuch proud Fellows, but turn them out of Doors? And if they ſhould come from time to time, and formally ask your Pardon for not doing your Will; and yet ſtill through Pride refuſe to do it, you would be ſo much the more incenſed againſt ſuch Raſcals. The Caſe is juſt the ſame between God and thy Self: however great thou art in thine own and the Worlds Opinion, thou art more inferiour to Him, then the meaneſt Scullion beneath thy ſelf; and it may be ſaid unto thee, with the ſame meaſure thou meaſureſt, it ſhall be meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out to thee, O thou wicked Servant. What canſt thou ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect but to be rejected by God, who in the time of thy Tryal wouldſt not do his Will, but only in what was agreeable to thy temporal advantage and Honour. When <hi>the day cometh that ſhall burn as an Oven, and all the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly ſhall be as ſtubble, and the day that cometh ſhall burn them up, ſaith the Lord,</hi> Mal. 4. 1. Will he accept of Pride as an excuſe for Sin, and Omiſſion of Duty? Becauſe thou wouldſt not be leſs eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of by thy Fellow-Servants. Whom were you bound to ſeek Honour of, they or him? It is better to be deſpiſed by all the World, then by him alone; and if that be ſo irkſome now, much
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:46484:108"/> more would it be to <hi>riſe up to everlaſting Shame and Contempt;</hi> and therefore it is reaſonable to ſubmit unto the leſs to avoid the greater. Saith the Lord Chriſt, <hi>If any Man ſerve me, let him fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low me, and where I am, there ſhall alſo my Servant be: if any Man ſerve me, him will my Father Honour,</hi> John 12. 26. Reſign them up all unto him, thy Body, Subſtance, Fame, Friends, Liberty and Life: And it may be, he will ſo diſpoſe of them all, that thou mayeſt keep them, and be his Servant; or if any be taken away, it may be reſtored double. Or whatever is loſt with ſome, may be gained with others. Yet if not, Obedience is more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent and acceptable with God, when it is with full purpoſe of Heart, come what will come, Life or Death, Shame and Diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, good Report and evil Report. The Service is pure and ſincere, when all Selfiſh ends and ſiniſter Conſiderations are ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed. When he Labours to approve himſelf unto God, and not as in the ſight of Men. When he can be content to walk in obſcurity and Contempt all his Life long, and make ſure of his Approbation, which is laſting, and carries Reward with it; which will make ſufficient Compenſation for want of a ſhort and empty Applauſe. The more he is deſpiſed by Men for Well-doing, the more he ſhall be had in Honour by God. If the Heart be ſeaſoned <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

But had thoſe who aſperſe herewith ſo much Wit and Ingenuity, (for ſuch Revilings are never the effect <note place="margin">Pſal. 15. 3.</note> of the Grace and Fear of God) to conſider throughly of that Rule, by which all Chriſtians are to walk, and they muſt go ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly according to it, if they would have the Peace conſequent to ſo doing, and the future Reward thereof; then I ſay, that they cannot reaſonably condemn him who lives moſt according to it. It is eſteemed no fault punctually to obſerve National Laws, Eccleſiaſtical Canons, and Humane Conſtitutions. And
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:46484:109"/> then why ſhould they be blamed, who call themſelves Followers of Jeſus, to do according to all the Laws he hath given them?

If he calls them Friends, there is no Reaſon why others ſhould call them Fools, unleſs who eſteem his Doctrine Fooliſhneſs; but moſt certainly they ſhould not, who <hi>name the name of Chriſt,</hi> and do not <hi>depart from iniquity;</hi> and therefore ſpeak in Contempt of thoſe which do, hereby to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe themſelves from not living according to the Rules of their Profeſſion. But by thus doing, <hi>They add iniquity to their iniquity, and not come into thy Righteouſneſs,</hi> Pſal. 69. 27. It was the ſaying of one, The Speculative Atheiſt was the greateſt wonder in the World, except one, and he was the Practical Atheiſt. Nothing can be ſo ſtrange and fooliſh, as he who believes the Goſpel, and yet doth live accordingly, but the greateſt part of Mankind be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this number, they would reverſe this if poſſible, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count him a ſimple Fellow, who lives according to it: So migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily hath Satan prevailed in the hearts of Men, as to make them believe any thing which may advance his Kingdom. But this is the moſt unaccountable folly that can be, and not fit to be enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained among reaſonable Souls. Good God! how ridiculous is it that they who profeſs to believe, that keeping thy Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments is the way to Eternal Life, yet ſhould account thoſe fooliſh who do them? They All agree, it is a Mans higheſt Wiſdom to uſe the right means to obtain the greateſt Happineſs; they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge Obedience to all Gods Laws is ſuch, and yet they would fain eſteem him fooliſh who doth thus: ſo they would raiſe a falſe concluſion from true and right premiſes, which is impoſſible, and here as abſurd, as any thing in the World can be. One would admire that Men of underſtanding ſhould ſwallow down ſuch an Opinion; it is taken in with the generality without conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for they know that in wordly concerns, when one is in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit of a Temporal Good, as an Eſtate, Office or preferment, it is Wiſdom to make uſe of all the probable means which may help towards obtaining thereof, to leave no ſtone unturned; for they ſay, a Man can never be too ſure: Yet theſe believe there is an Heaven, which doth exceed whatever is here below; that it is every Mans buſineſs to get him an Intereſt therein, that the moſt likely way to get thither, is to do according to all thoſe Directions in Scripture, and why then ſhould not ſuch an one be

Let all the World ſay or think what they will, Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Truth are immutable, and cannot be toſſed too and fro by the Breath of fooliſh talking People; they are Emanations from the Divine Nature, and in this corrupted State, where truth is hated, Wiſdom cryeth out, but few hear the voice, they are not to be found among the multitude, ſo that one muſt be wiſer then the Generality, or he will not be wiſe at all, as the end will prove: When it ſhall be better to have been among Chriſt's little Flock, then the common Herd.

And not to do as the Generality doth, is reckoned Singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity; now to ſhew forth a Chriſtian Converſation in good Works, is not what the moſt, but only few do: And therefore it is thus accounted of. But let none be diſcouraged with this term of Reproach; for even the Men of this World who decry it ſo much, would with all their Hearts be ſingular if they might; none would refuſe to be the only rich Man in his Pariſh; neither would the Ambitious refuſe an high Title of Honour, becauſe none in the Countrey beſides had the like. This is the thing they aim at, to be more wealthy and honourable then the reſt of their Neighbours: Every private Perſon would willingly be more Happy then others, and will uſe the means to be ſo: And it is eſteemed no fault to direct their Actions accordingly, but Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom for every one to advance his own intereſt as much as he can, although he gets above others. This is the Senſe of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind as to wordly Matters, and there is the very ſame Reaſon, it ſhould be ſo likewiſe in <hi>things pertaining to endleſs Life.</hi> Every ſingle Perſon would ſave his own Soul, and be for ever Happy; if he ſhould miſcarry, he bears all the loſs himſelf; and others will never be able to help him. Why then ſhould he be blamed, if he trys to ſecure himſelf? And ſeeing there is but one way, which is Godlineſs, wherefore ſhould he be leſſened for walking in it? Becauſe others do not, that is their fault, not his, he muſt look to himſelf. He is to ſtand upon his own Legs, and therefore it muſt be his buſineſs to take heed he doth not fall; for if he ſhould and others fall with him, he only would feel the Pain of it, and they when fallen will not be able to help him up. It is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſaid, every Man hath Power over himſelf; let him follow his own Humour; and though if we are toucht with a feeling of Humane Nature, we ſhould endeavour to do another Good, and be inſtrumental to his Happineſs; yet it muſt be a ſtrange Savageneſs, when inſtead of doing this, we are Angry and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lign him only, for endeavouring after it himſelf.

If concerning a Religious Perſon, it paſſes current and uncontradicted; but if of another, there will be enough to make Excuſes for him, to Examine throughly and detect it of Falſhood in one part, and ſo daſh it in the whole, but as to him they are ready to add ſomething to render it more odious. <hi>The wicked plotteth againſt the juſt, and gnaſheth upon him with his Teeth,</hi> Pſal. 37. 12. And therefore they caſt Reproaches, laugh and do any thing to blemiſh his Fame and Reputation. This hath been, and is the uſage of the World.

               <p>To lay in a greater Foundation by good Works, to abound in Chriſtian Graces and Vertues, is the way to receive a greater Reward in Heaven.

What doth it ſignifie to fly a little from that, which will at length overtake them?

It is generally granted, he is more happy then others in reference to another life, and the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies of this; but is he ſo as pertaining to preſent enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments?

<pb n="214" facs="tcp:46484:116"/> ſhall fail, and that Honour which is to be laid in the Duſt. <hi>They are Children and Heirs of God, and Joynt-Heirs with Chriſt,</hi> Rom. 8. 17. and if we believe theſe Relations do exceed thoſe of the World, it can be no more a Diſparagement to Converſe with them, then the Son and Heir of a Nobleman, though as yet he hath not one Farthing of his Fathers Demeſnes. <hi>By this we know that we love the Children of God, when we love God and keep his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments,</hi> 1 John 5. 2. And ſo again, if we love God, that will be manifeſted towards his <hi>Choſen Ones, his Sons, his Elect, his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,</hi> and whom he vouchſafes to ſtile by all Expreſſions of kindneſs. <hi>We know that we have paſſed from Death to Life, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we love the Brethren,</hi> 1 John 3. 14. Where is love, there an Union is deſired with the object beloved, and accordingly will be had. Let none diſſemble, God knoweth the Heart, and for what Reaſon it is, if any neglects his Duty in this particular. If he deſpiſe the Poor and low Eſtate of faithful People, <hi>What ſhall he do, when God riſeth up? And when he viſiteth, what ſhall he anſwer him?</hi> Job 31. 14. Let him ſhew that he doth not, by a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Converſation with them; let him be gentle, eaſie to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated, uſe Hoſpitality without grudging, ſpeak Friendly as one Man talketh to another without ſcornful or ruff Language. And let them be advertiſed from, <hi>Iſa. 3. 5.

               <p>
                  <hi>The Bleſſing of the Lord it maketh rich, and addeth no Sorrow with it,</hi> Prov. 10. 22. ſo in his Word he hath preſcribed a moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent way for their Station and Circumſtances, by which they are freed from thoſe Miſeries, others of like Condition are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject unto: and then they enjoy the Comforts here, in a much better way. The Service of God, doing good to their Countrey, Meditation and Reading, the Affairs of humane Life, thoſe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate and innocent Delights, do take off from the Irkſomeneſs and Tediouſneſs of time; ſo they live happily and paſs through here with more Reſt and Quietneſs, then others who take no Care what ſhall become of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, Let not the wiſe man Glory in his Wiſdom, neither let the mighty man Glory in his might; but let him that Glorieth, Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in this that he underſtandeth and knoweth me,</hi> Jer. 9. 23, 24. 'Tis not noble Birth and Extraction, but that Relation which the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:46484:116"/> vouchſafes to have towards mankind, which makes them truly Honourable. <hi>Have we not all one Father? hath not one God created us?</hi> Mal. 2. 10. Nay, have we not the ſame Father after the Fleſh? Are we not all the Sons of a Gardiner? In the moſt Ancient and illuſtrious Family, if the ſeveral mean deſcents could be traced up, thoſe Anceſtors would be found out where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of none hath Reaſon to be proud of: What the Prophet ſaith, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 3, 4, 5, 6. is ſufficient to abaſe any one concerning his Original, and ſhould be an inducement not to truſt in his own, but <hi>to ſeek that Honour which cometh from God only, John</hi> 5. 44. His Providence hath ordered the ſeveral diſtinctions in the World, and hath placed them in ſeveral Seats to work out their own Salvation. It is no diminiſhing, but encreaſe of preſent Happineſs to comply with the Good will of God. <hi>Wealth and Riches ſhall be in his Houſe,</hi> Pſal. 112. 3. they are already; but there is ſomewhat better nearer within, <hi>The Satisfaction of a good Conſcience.</hi> He is Clothed well, ſuffers neither Hunger nor Thirſt, Cold nor Nakedneſs. God hath given him both ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual and temporal Bleſſings. By the firſt he doth Love and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour his Great Benefactor: And he doth not ſet his Heart upon the things that are ſeen (for that is the great danger of Worldly abundance) but uſes them to Miniſter only unto his Pilgrimage: Being aſſured, that though theſe are good, yet God hath provided better things, that when this Happineſs (which is imperfect, and for a time) is to be determined, he is to arrive at that which is perfect, and to endure throughout all Ages. When ſuch an one is to be taken away from his fine Habitation, Eſtate, Wife, Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, Servants, and all that is eſteemed dear amongſt Men; in the ſight of the unbelieving World he may ſeem to die, and his Departure be taken for Loſs and Miſery: Whereas <hi>he ſhall enter into Peace: They ſhall reſt in their Beds, each one walking in his up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſs,</hi> Iſa. 57. 2. Then only his true and uninterrupted Feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city begins, which ſhall never end. Wouldſt thou be in this Mans Condition? <hi>Go thou, and do likewiſe.</hi>

               <argument>
                  <p>It is the Duty of all to be in ſome Calling: An Exhortation to ſerve God: Againſt Ignorance, and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelief: Some Conſiderations of living in the World, and further drawn from the four laſt things. Of different Communions: Of Deceits. A Deſcription of the Wicked and Godly in this World.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>OF this Order they are reputed in the World, who do not live of their own, but follow ſome Trade or Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And here it may not be improper to ſpeak ſomewhat concerning that, and the Obligation all lye under to it.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as God created Man, he was appointed ſome work to do, even in his beſt Eſtate of innocency. But then was Labour without Sorrow and Tireſomeneſs, for it was after added, <hi>Gen. 3. 17, 19. In Sorrow ſhalt thou eat all the days of thy Life, in the ſweat of thy Face ſhalt thou eat Bread.</hi> This was pronounced on him for us all, for all have ſinned in him, and who can plead Freedom from it? If we expect the Bleſſing of the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> it is meet we ſhould ſubmit to the Condition of the firſt: Neither doth that Diſpenſation wherewith Chriſt hath made us Free, exempt here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; for one ſaith, who knew the utmoſt extent of it. <hi>Thoſe walk diſorderly which work not at all. Now them that are ſuch, we Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and exhort by our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that with quietneſs they work and eat their own Bread,</hi> 2 Theſ. 3. 11, 12.

<pb n="217" facs="tcp:46484:117"/> for ſome have not ſtrength of Body, and their Education is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other way; but yet may do as much good, and be ſerviceable to their Countrey, as thoſe who do reap and ſow. The Promiſe of eternal Life is to keeping the Commandments, whereof the ſecond is, <hi>Thou ſhalt love thy Neighbour as thy ſelf;</hi> which obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges to do thoſe ſeveral good and neceſſary Offices for him, which we would have done for our ſelves. But how agrees herewith that proud and ſelfiſh Spirit, who would have others do any thing for him? the Poor muſt dung his Ground, Cut his Corn, and be ſerviceable unto him, but he will not contribute towards their good in ſo large a manner as he expects they ſhould do for his. He ſpeaks diſdainfully and contemptuouſly of thoſe who drudge and ſlave for a Livelihood, and bleſſes himſelf, becauſe he is not forced to an Employment for Bread; for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed few do take any upon them, unleſs by conſtraint, or gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Deſires after encreaſe; but who doth ſo only out of Conſcience <note place="margin">Neh. 5. 15. 18.</note> towards God? <hi>The heads thereof judge for Reward, and the Prieſts thereof teach for hire,</hi> Mic. 3. 11. The fault is in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king that the ultimate end, when they would not do ſo much unleſs for the Profits and Maintenance belonging to ſuch Offices, and theſe are principally intended. To be in ſome Calling is our Duty, and alſo it frees from the Miſery and Sin of idleneſs. We have reſtleſs and buſie Spirits, which muſt be Converſant about ſomething: Both the Faculties of mind and Members of Body were deſigned for Proper Action, they are uneaſie when not employed. Such a kind of Life is more wretched and irk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, then the m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Theſe three go together in too many Men and Women of this Nation, and have Connexion: The laſt is the natural reſult of the two former, for through haughtineſs of mind and Sloth, which is the conſequent of Exceſs, comes that Contempt and neglect of honeſt Callings. When the Wiſdom of God hath ordered Man to work and labour, they Fancy them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves <note place="margin">Pſal. 104. 23, 24.</note> too good for it. So they either think themſelves to be ſomewhat above Men, or that to be unbecoming them. But they ſhould have a great Care how they deſpiſe Divine Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, becauſe of what is written, <hi>Numb.</hi> 15. 30, 31. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 28.
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:46484:118"/> 
                  <hi>The Son of God came into the World not to be Miniſtred unto, but to Miniſter.</hi> But ſome contrariwiſe think, others ought to do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but ſerve and cringe unto them: For all their high Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations, they are but Men; be they never ſo Selfiſh, they ſtand in need of others: ſo it is both Conſcience and Reaſon they ſhould do as they would be done by, and be alike uſeful unto others. But the nice and delicate Souls do not love Trouble or Pains; if they would throughly rouze themſelves from Lethargy, they would find more delight then ever they did in the unactive man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Life: The being accuſtomed to buſineſs or bodily Labour makes it Pleaſant, and takes off from the Irkſomeneſs of Life. It ſeems ſtrange that thoſe who greedily hunt after Happineſs, ſhould yet give way to Idleneſs; which is a Torment and Vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Soul. Is it becauſe they have more time to enjoy Pleaſures? When they are had continually, they ceaſe to be ſuch. Intermingle Work with Play, and both would be delightful; but if one followed only the latter, it is more Tireſome then to go all day long to Plough and Cart. It is not only a Matter of temporal Conveniency, but is neceſſary in order to eternal Reſt and Happineſs. So it ſtands as to the means of obtaining it, and prevention of the hindrances, which are Temptation and Sin. Let the Devil never find thee idle (was the good Advice of one) for then he cannot tempt thee. At times of leiſure he is moſt buſie, ſuggeſting Pride and ſpiritual Wickedneſs, all things to begnile and loſe ſomewhat of our Reward. In that time alſo the Solicitations of the World preſent themſelves, and we Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley with them. But the worſt of all is from within: <hi>The heart which is deſperately wicked,</hi> when it hath no outward Object to fix on, that Corruption lurking there begins to ſtir. It will run after Theft, Covetouſneſs, Luſt, and all manner of Evil; which breaks forth into iniquity and diſobedience. It may be obſerved of ſeveral, who are rightly diſpoſed to the ways of Good, but they have nothing to do, and not knowing how to ſpend their time, reſort to the Pleaſures of Sin and idle Company; which either choak, or ſtop the growth of <hi>the Good Seed.</hi> So mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hath idleneſs contributed to Satans Kingdom, and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of Souls; which ſhould have been prevented by honeſt Labour and Employment.</p>
               <pb n="219" facs="tcp:46484:118"/>
               <p>But ſome make an Excuſe from that, becauſe they would have more leiſure for Religion; whereas that if uſed aright doth not thruſt out, but help towards it. They were both ordained to ſtand together, and Conſiſtent with each other; for the ſame God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed all. The common miſtake is of conſining the whole to one part, as placing all in Acts of Godlineſs and Devotion, which is but one third; and therefore not to ſhut out from the other Duties: <hi>I have not cauſed thee to ſerve with an Offering, nor wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried thee with incenſe,</hi> Iſa. 43. 23. 'Tis not required of any one to tire his Soul with long Prayers, and our Saviour Chriſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks of the <hi>Heathen, who think they ſhall be heard for their much ſpeaking,</hi> Mat. 6. 7. The Sacrifices were offered up under the Law <hi>every Morning and Evening,</hi> but not the whole Day; except the Sabbath-day, for which was ordered <hi>a double and continual burnt Offering,</hi> Numb. 28. 9, 10. Thereby giving to ſignifie, that the day which is even now ſet apart for the immediate Service of God, ſhould be wholly ſpent in ſacred Duties. <hi>Six days ſhalt thou Labour, and do all that thou haſt to do.</hi> God could have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided things without our Labour, if his Wiſdom had thought fit; but having ordained that, a Man who is faithful and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent <note place="margin">Col. 3. 24.</note> therein, ſerves him as acceptably at that time, as in holy things at another: Nothing hinders, but that in the midſt of our Work there may be a conſtant Sence of God over our mind, and a fixed purpoſe not to offend in any thing: <hi>So is the Will of God that none ſhould live unto himſelf, but unto him, who hath called us in one hope of our Calling,</hi> and alſo ſome manner of Life, that we may get neceſſaries for our Being here: And if we have them already; yet to <hi>work with our hands to give to him that needeth,</hi> Eph. 4. 28. If we have that alſo, yet ſtill we are to be beneficial unto others.</p>
               <p>Not one of a thouſand, who is in a Trade or Employment, neglects that for the buſineſs of Religion: and who is in none, not this, but ſomething elſe is the real Cauſe. Men generally run to the other extream, and will not allow that time they might conveniently for the Service of God. If one ſhould employ an hour or two more then ordinary in a Week, he would be more accuſed of negligence, then who conſumes thrice the time in Drinking-houſes, or Fruitleſs Recreations; ſo apt are we to grudge in ourſelves every minute more then needs muſt. Who hears the word Preached, or goes to publick Prayers on Week<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:46484:119"/> doth Act as one that believeth the Goſpel and lives accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly. <note place="margin">Acts 26. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Daniel</hi> were both engaged in much Worldly buſineſs and matters of State, yet we read what they did, <hi>Pſal. 55. 17. Pſal. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

So that time, which others think loſt, may be gainful as to the preſent; but moſt certainly it is to the future. We have known ſeveral inſtances of thoſe, who through Sin or Careleſneſs have came to Poverty, but never any by thus doing. That of the Apoſtle is obſervable as if he had foreſeen what People would make a P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>If one did behold all the Tranſactions and Labour under the Sun, how thoſe ſeveral Stations and Employments are appointed unto Men: Every one conduces to the benefit of the whole, and hath Connexion one to another, he ought to Praiſe him who ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth over all. <hi>O Lord, how manifold are thy works! in Wiſdom haſt thou made them all, the Earth is full of thy Riches,</hi> Pſal. 104 24.

Every ſingle Tradesman and Labourer doth further the Need and Delight of mankind; even thoſe which ſeem to be meaneſt and leſs ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable, do neceſſarily conduce towards it, as Husbandry. The ſeveral Employments in the World tend to our Good, in the different Capacities of Mind, Body and Eſtate. None is to be deſpiſed, for we have all our Treaſure in Earthen Veſſels, and the lower kinds of Labour are fitted to the Suſtenance and Well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>being of them: So they likewiſe do contribute to the benefit of our better part. He that is in the moſt worthy Station, ſtands in need of the unworthy, as well as this Man doth of him. <hi>The whole Body fitly joyned together, and compacted by that, which every joynt ſupplieth according to the effectual Working in the meaſure of every part, maketh increaſe of the Body, unto the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Thoſe who would account it ſo, and make a mock of the labour of the Poor, may be deſpiſed by their great Maſter; when thoſe who have been uſed to hardſhip and diligence in the World, may be admitted into the Reſt that remaineth for the people of God. They are in the ready road to Heaven, if to their Pains they will add Godlineſs, Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Sobriety; if they do theſe things, they ſhall never fail: The temptations of the World, Fleſh and Devil will not ſo eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prevail againſt them, whoſe time is taken up with honeſt la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour; The promiſes are more peculiar to them, <hi>Mat. 11. 5. Luk. 6. 20. Jam. 2. 5. 1 Cor.</hi> 1. 27. Our Lord choſe for his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples none of the learned <hi>Phariſees,</hi> or <hi>Rabbins,</hi> but Fiſhermen, and of other mean Occupations; he called them at that very time, <hi>As</hi> Levi <hi>when he was ſitting at the receit of cuſtom,</hi> Luke 5. 27. Simon Peter <hi>and</hi> Andrew <hi>his Brother, as they were caſting a Net into the Sea. And going on from thence, he ſaw two other Brethren,</hi> James <hi>the Son of</hi> Zebedee, <hi>and</hi> John <hi>his Brother in a Ship with</hi> Zebedee, <hi>their Father mending their Nets, and he called them, Mat.</hi> 4. 18, 21. The good News of his coming into the World, was firſt told to the <hi>Shepherds abiding in the Field, and keeping watch over their flock by Night,</hi> Luke 2. 8. So God appeared to <hi>Moſes,</hi> Exod. 3. 1, 2. <hi>To</hi> Gideon <hi>as he was threſhing,</hi> Judg. 6. 11, 12. Thus acceptable it is unto him when Men abide, and are diligent in their calling; he doth not eſteem them the leſs, but rather chooſes them for the meanneſs thereof. In his Holy Word there are many particular alluſions to the ſeveral Trades in the World, as the <hi>Husbandman, Carpenter, Smith, Potter, Shepherd,</hi> and ſuch like; they are upon ſuch ſure grounds of obtaining a future
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:46484:120"/> Happineſs, and there is ſo much reaſon theſe ſhould ſeek dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently after it, that it would be an admiration if any ſhould miſs thereof.</p>
               <p>Yet alas! God is not known amongſt them all, no, nor the greateſt part; though they are more encouraged as having the promiſes, of which ſort was Chriſt himſelf and the Apoſtles. It is exceedingly to be pityed, that the Word of God upon them alſo ſhould have no more effect; <hi>Hearken my beloved Brethren, Hath not God choſen the poor of this World, rich in Faith, and heirs of the Kingdom which he hath promiſed to them that love him? Jam.</hi> 2. 5. Why therefore will you not alſo chooſe him to be your God? Some have done ſo, but why will you not all? Indeed one would im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agine every ſingle Soul ſhould do ſo, unleſs he did caſt his eyes out into the World; and then he might ſee Satan hath a Kingdom among theſe equally as the great ones of the Earth. Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is not confined to high Places, nor inhabiteth only in fine Houſes; but hath ſpread among thoſe of low Eſtate, and crept into the ſmalleſt Cottages. Oppreſſion, Bribery, and Injuſtice are in great Employments; Couſenage, Lying, and all manner of deceit do accompany every inferior Trade: there is a knaviſh part, a Myſtery of iniquity interwoven into it, and is peculiar to each profeſſion. There is a general failure of Truth and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice from among us; <hi>I have ſeen violence and ſtrife in the City, miſchief alſo and ſorrow are in the midſt of it, deceit and guile de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part not from her ſtreets,</hi> Pſal. 55. 9, 10. In the Country is over-reaching one another, each Man trys to impoſe upon his Neighbour; the hireling loyters and is negligent in his Maſters buſineſs. The poor in time of leaſing will break the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for a morſel of bread and handful of barley, if they have opportunity of taking it from the heap and not be diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: They are every where corrupt in their dealings, there is hardly one that doth juſtly. They will exclaim againſt the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchery of the Rich, and perhaps out of an ill humour, becauſe themſelves are reſtrained from ſinning after the ſame manner through want; but they will equal them in another kind by Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honeſty, Falſhood, and Murmuring: and the ſame Spirit of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience would lead them to commit the ſame ſins (they now ſpeak againſt) if they had where-withal. The Word of God is gone forth againſt all manner of Sin and Iniquity, and it will ſignifie nothing at his Judgment, to ſay, you did not commit ſuch
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:46484:120"/> and ſuch, if you did of another ſort; Ignorance, contempt of and repining againſt God, Slandering, Lying, and Theft are as damnable as Whoredom, Drunkenneſs, or Gluttony.

               <p>Indeed <hi>the Kingdom of God is not meat and drink,</hi> Rom. 14. 17. but things as will better ſatisfie then they do now: For you eat and drink, and hunger and thirſt again: But if you would ſeek after that, in the mean time you would be quieted with the hopes and Faith thereof, till you come actually to <hi>ſit down at the Marriage Supper of the Lamb.</hi> A Supper, to which all the Dainties of the World are as ſtinking Carrion.

               <p>What would you not do at preſent, if you could get ſuch an Eſtate as ſome of thy rich Neighbours have? you would think nothing too hard, many a Sleepleſs Night and laborious Day you would ſuffer with all your Heart, if you might attain it: But thou ſeeſt no way or poſſibility, if thou wouldſt never ſo much deſire to do it: Well, be contented nevertheleſs, and aſſure thy ſelf, that if thou art not ſlothful, but come unto him, who <hi>will meet thee in the way of Righteouſneſs,</hi> and then follow hard after him, thou ſhalt undoubtedly come to Heaven; when the Great Ones, if wicked and diſobedient, ſhall be thruſt down with Shame and Confuſion.

               <p>Saith the ſame Divine Witneſs, <hi>I heard a voice from Heaven Saying unto me, Write, Bleſſed are the dead which die in the Lord from henceforth, yea, ſaith the Spirit, that they may reſt from their Labours
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:46484:126"/> and their Works do follow them,</hi> Rev. 14. 13. All do not ſo, but only thoſe who die in the Lord. That Saying ſo common in the mouth of Country People, <hi>When ſuch an one is dead, he is hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py</hi> (becauſe freed from the Pains and Miſeries of Life) is falſe when applyed to all indifferently, good and bad; for this Bleſſing belongs only to thoſe who have led a Godly Life. By Death, <hi>we fall into the hands of the living God,</hi> and then he may deal with us as ſeemeth good in his ſight; however, being a God of Truth he will do ſo with all of us, as is declared in his Word which is Truth. And therefore it will be ſo with us according as we order our Converſation in this preſent World, by the words written in that Book. Seeing the Caſe is thus, it muſt be the more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent way to fit our ſelves accordingly. We often provide for thoſe things which never happen; and if they ſhould, are but of ſmall moment. Shall we not much more prepare againſt that which will certainly come, and is of greater Concern to every one of us, then any thing now in the World is? All our Care now is to keep Life for the preſent; and ſhall no Care be had to live for ever? We can never do too much to preſerve Health, and keep of ſullen Death as long as we can: And ſhall not we do the ſame to eſcape the ſecond Death, that wretched Condition in <hi>which Men ſhall ſeek for Death, and it ſhall flee from them?</hi> With all our Pains we cannot hold of temporal Death, and yet we would; we may by the Grace of God preſerve our ſelves from eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Death, and there we will not. Oh ſtrange madneſs! O un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable Folly! O ye Sons of Men, who hath bewitched you to Act ſo Prepoſterouſly? Death in it ſelf is not more grievous then Pain or Sickneſs now is (nay not ſo much, for as in Health we fall aſleep when we do not perceive it, ſo then thoſe violent Pangs deſtroy the Sence and Feeling) but that which comes to the wicked after renders it exceeding terrible, and that ſhould be moſt dreaded; which would not be in vain, becauſe it would make us flee from the wrath to come. Would we take as great heed leaſt we die after Death, as now we do to ſave our ſelves from Death; then Death ſhould have no Dominion over us, it ſhall not bring Evil, but Good unto us. <hi>The ſting of Death is ſin,</hi> but Command is given to pluck that out. <hi>Caſt away from you all your Tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, whereby ye have Tranſgreſſed, and make you a new Heart and a new Spirit; for why will ye die, O houſe of</hi> Iſrael? <hi>for I have no Pleaſure in the Death of him that dieth, ſaith the Lord God.

Such a Death is like a drunken Mans falling down a ſteep Rock, his Sot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſhneſs hath caſt him into ſuch a Sleep, that he knows not whether he is tumbling; notwithſtanding he comes to a fearful end. One dead in Treſpaſſes and Sins perceives not whether he tends, when he is juſt dropping into the Fire; yet as ſoon as he is there, he is ſenſible to a Witneſs, and ſo will remain for evermore. Whatever gnorant By-ſtanders may think, ſuch a ſort of Death muſt be a ſad ſight to all knowing Chriſtians; for who can approve of what is occaſioned by unbelief, groſs Ignorance, or habitual Wickedneſs? All which Seal men up to the Day of Deſtruction: There is a great difference between this and the end of the Righteous; for the one is Senceleſs, and Calls not upon God but in a general way, as Lord have mercy upon me, or the like, which any one may do if he be never ſo ungodly: But the other can expreſs his Peaceable Condition, and ſhew forth good Grounds of hope, and call upon God his Saviour with that fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſs which no Stranger to the Covenant of Grace can. <hi>Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs delivereth from Death,</hi> Prov. 11. 4.

Let them ruffle and ſport themſelves never ſo much, their End is coming. They muſt ſicken, and go away to Account for all their Frolick and Madneſs. There is ſet before thee a good and evil Death; one you muſt have, and therefore be ſure to chooſe the beſt. Be good and do Good, and thou ſhalt never die amiſs.

Nay, if I may ſo ſpeak, we have more Civility from the Great God, then from exalted Earth-Worms: For they are Men of Pride, look for At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance, and therefore will be hard to be ſpoken withal. <hi>But the Lord will wait that he may be gracious, for the Lord is a God of Judgment. Bleſſed are all they that wait for him,</hi> Iſa. 30. 18. The things he hath provided are as worthy to be waited for, and it is meet we ſhould pay the ſame and greater reſpect to Almighty God, as is done to <hi>Man whoſe breath is in his Noſtrils, for wherein is he to accounted of?</hi> Iſa. 2. 22. God doth wonderfully condeſcend to the Children of Men, to let his doings be judged of by them. <hi>Yet ſaith the Houſe of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>the way of the Lord is not equal O houſe of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>are not my wayes equal?

You have a reaſon, but are to be put in mind he is a God of Majeſty and Power; <hi>Known unto him are all his Works,</hi> Acts 15. 18. And he is not bound to give account of any; ſufficient for you to underſtand, and refer them all <hi>to the good pleaſure of his Will.</hi> Thus for his Promiſes and Threatnings he might accompliſh them whenſoever he would, and ſo they ſhall be in the appointed time; which though to come, yet will be moſt certainly. And conſidering how much every one of us are concerned in them, they ſhould more affect us then the things now do before us. If it be juſt, that he who builds an Houſe ſhould dwell in it; or he

The Fooliſhneſs of Men ſhall never Out-wit the <hi>All-wiſe God;</hi> neither ſhall he be put off with vain Excuſes or Pretences. <hi>The Lord is a God of knowledge, and by him Actions are weighed,</hi> 1 Sam. 2. 3. He is a God of Power, and none can get into his Manſions above without his Will; and he can make all the Devices of the wicked to be of none effect. He is a God of Truth, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore what he hath ſpoken in theſe laſt days by his Son, ſhall be fulfilled. Who ſaith, <hi>He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my words, hath one that judgeth him: the word that I have ſpoken, the ſame ſhall Judge him at the laſt day,</hi> John. 12. 48. And thoſe idle Pleas which guilty Perſons ſhall offer for themſelves, will not be allowed of, as appears, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 22, 23, and <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 44. So is the Caſe at this day; for at the Aſſizes no Priſoner how guilty ſoever would be Condemned, if every little trifle and excuſe he makes for himſelf, might be received and ſave his Life: Whereas the Judge doth not regard his idle Sayings and frivolous Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:46484:132"/> but proceeds againſt him for what he hath done according to the written Law of the Land. If Men flatter themſelves in Evil, becauſe they think they have a place of Scripture on their ſide; they are further to know, that according to the righteous Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of Chriſt, and not their own wicked Wreſtings, and Miſ-applications all muſt for ever ſtand or fall. As ſuch are all thoſe meanings which may ſeem to give allowance to any manner of Sin: For it is a certain and eternal Rule. <hi>Whatever Doctrine or Opinion doth Countenance living in any wilful and known Sin, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be of God; neither hath it any right Grounds from his Word.</hi> For though Men of Prevaricating minds do take Arguments from the Law of the Moſt High to favour that which his So<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

This is to <hi>pervert the right ways of the Lord, to do violence to his Law,</hi> and alſo they <hi>are partial</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; for they take up what ſeems to make for them, and neglect others which are manifeſtly contrary to what they would have. If ſuch a thing is for their Gain or Delight, although plainly forbidden as they cannot deny, yet they commit it ſafely without fear from ſuch an Example or Expreſſion they found therein, and however far fetcht it ſhall ſerve to their purpoſe.

The Apoſtle was of another mind, when he ſaid, <hi>Abſtain from all appearance of Evil,</hi> 1 Theſ. 5. 22. And the great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand <hi>of loving God with all the Heart</hi> (which comprehends all the very Thoughts and Intents thereof) dictates other Doctrine; for that doth not admit of any thing which comes near diſpleaſing of him. In doubtful things to refrain is the ſafer way; for to do without being perſwaded, or conſidering the Lawfulneſs of them, argues more of wicked Preſumption, then Godly diſcretion. The common Decelt is, they think it no Evil, and therefore it is not ſo; whereas Chriſt will judge the Secrets of Men by his Goſpel, and not by their own Thoughts: in the mean while by the Law is the knowledge of Good and Evil, and not by a private Spirit.</p>

They would have God to be all Mercy: Indeed it is greater then can be expreſſed, but then why will they not in the mean time ſincerely endeavour to be ſo qualified, that they may be Partakers thereof. His other attributes muſt be alſo taken in, Wiſdom, Juſtice, Truth, and Holineſs; What God was in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, the ſame he is now, and ſo continues for evermore, <hi>With whom is no Variableneſs, neither ſhadow of turning,</hi> Jam. 1. 17.

               <p>It is a vain and abſurd Fancy, that ſome flatter themſelves with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, that things are ſo, becauſe they wiſh and would have them ſo. If they could reach up and pull down the High and Lofty One, lead away Captive (as hath been done with dumb Idols) the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and Almighty God; then indeed, but not before, they might <note place="margin">Iſa. 24. 5.</note> reverſe and make void the Ordinances of Heaven, them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves give Laws to the Soveraign Diſpoſer of all things, and make them according to their own Fancy and Deſire.

Thus to imagine is more ſilly then the Fool who <hi>ſaith in his heart, there is no God;</hi> for it is not ſo abſurd as to think there is one, but he is to do whatever vile Miſcreants would have him: Surely among all the Fooliſhneſs of Men there is not ſuch to be found; yet how common is it for them to get a fine and pleaſant Notion concerning their own eternal State, and
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:46484:134"/> conclude themſelves Happy therein, as if it muſt neceſſarily be ſo, becauſe now they Fancy ſo, and at laſt it was to depend upon their own idle Conceits, but not the infallible Judgment and ſure word of God. But for all they cannot fully perſwade themſelves of their own Deceits; a thought will return (though endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be ſtifled) that it may be otherwiſe. If they would retire into the Spirit of their minds, ſetting aſide that Willingneſs to be deceived, they would be even condemned of themſelves. If they did ſearch and examine their own Conſciences, and that not light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and after the manner of Diſſemblers with God, they cannot raiſe to themſelves ſuch falſe Hopes and Expectations as ſome do. They are diſobedient and willing to remain ſo, and therefore are deceived.</p>
               <p>Why they refrain from groſs Sins, no Extortioner, no Swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, and ſuch like they ſay they are: But do they refrain from all? <hi>Whoſoever ſhall keep the whole Law, and offend in one point is Guilty of all, Jam.</hi> 2. 10. It is as much oppoſing the Will of God in one inſtance as in twenty. When that commandeth ſuch <note place="margin">1 Kings 11 2.

The continued diſobedience of one Precept involves in the ſame Condemnation as of many, 1 <hi>Cor. 6. 9, 10. Rev. 21. 8. The Kingdom of Heaven is like unto a Treaſure hid in a Field, the which when a Man hath found he hideth, and for joy thereof goeth and ſelleth all that he hath, and buyeth that Field,</hi> Mat. 13. 44. he muſt part with all Sin and Wickedneſs if he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to come there. It may be ſaid that cannot be, <hi>For in many things we offend all,</hi> Jam. 3. 2. But it muſt of every known habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Sin, for that may be done. <hi>Ye have not yet reſiſted unto Blood, ſtriving againſt ſin,</hi> Heb. 12. 4. This ſounds harſh, who can do it? Any one that will ſeriouſly, and in good earneſt endeavour to do ſo.</p>
               <p>What God hath ſaid and decreed cannot be altered, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it concerns us to try and examine our ſelves, that when the Lord cometh we may be found accepted of him, <hi>It is appointed for all once to die, and after that to Judgment,</hi> Heb. 9. 27. When all Tricks and Evaſions ſhall be diſcovered, and fully anſwered to the Confuſion of thoſe, who make uſe of them. Men may now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe themſelves before their Neighbours and Acquaintance, who
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:46484:135"/> know not as God knows, the very Secrets of all Hearts. The Conſideration of a Judgment to come ſhould make us ſuſpect our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, for not every one that is perſwaded of his own Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, is accepted with God, but whom he approveth. Moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly People have too haſty and good Opinion of their own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, they preſently think themſelves fit for Heaven, and they, <note place="margin">1 Sam. 15. 13.</note> have an intereſt in Chriſt, and will cry out <hi>Lord, Lord,</hi> as if they were his own, <hi>When he ſhall profeſs to them, I know ye not, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from me ye that Work iniquity,</hi> Mat. 7. 22, 23. If they do that, the Lord Jeſus will diſown, and not admit them into his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. All their falſe Thoughts will avail nothing at that time, but now they breed Unconcernedneſs and Preſumption. Men are willing to be quiet and cannot endure to be diſturbed, but let them conſider this one thing. That if they ſhould periſh by the deceiveableneſs of Satan and their own Hearts, it will be moſt ſad to think (and worſe then it is now to have their preſent eaſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted) that if they had found it out, which they would not when they might, they had avoided all this Miſery. Thoſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braidings of paſt irrepairable Folly, will be no little Addition to it. After-Wit is never good, but in a thing of this moment, where is no poſſibility of remedying the miſtake, is more Senſeleſs and inexcuſable. <hi>O Jeruſalem, if thou hadſt known in this thy day the things that belong to thy Peace, but now they are hid from thine Eyes.</hi> Could we come to ſpeak with thoſe, who whilſt they lived, <hi>walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in away right in their own Eyes, but find the paths thereof to have lead unto Death:</hi> How would theſe wretched Creatures accuſe themſelves for running on perfunctorily in their Courſe, without throughly conſidering whither it did tend? They would lament their Careleſsneſs, and neglect of making their Calling and Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction ſure. I am perſwaded, they would teſtifie unto us to take all heed, that we be not deceived in like manner. They muſt acknowledge God righteous, for his word makes known all Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, and would have <hi>done good unto them, if they had walked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightly,</hi> Mic. 2. 7. but they did follow their own Hearts Counſel, and would have none of his, then what they did frame agreeable to their own. O that they might have another day of Grace, and Amendment of paſt miſtakes! Nothing can be granted againſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal and immutable Decrees. But we on this ſide of the Grave may do it; but if we will not, we ſhall paſs into the ſame Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, there is no remedy, if we will not when we may, when
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:46484:135"/> we are ſo earneſtly called upon and intreated, and ſhewed how we may eſcape. There are now abroad in the World, <hi>Men ſporting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with their own deceivings,</hi> 2 Pet. 2. 13. Who live in ſome wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or other, and yet <hi>paſs the time of their ſojourning without fear;</hi> who ſtand continually at the entrance of Eternity, but take no due care leaſt the gates of Hell be opened upon them; And why ſhould any one be thought evil of, who acquaints them of their danger, that they may go further from it. As long as they are in any way of Wickedneſs, they are not in the right way; and whether ſuch will know it or no, <hi>Thou haſt rebuked the proud that are curſed, which do err from thy Commandments,</hi> Pſal. 119. 21.</p>
               <p>That fancy which allows in the practice of any ſin, or which excuſes from obeying any one ſingle Goſpel Precept pertaining to ſuch a Man or Relation, is a meer deceit, and is damnable. <hi>There are many devices in Mans heart, nevertheleſs the counſel of the Lord that ſhall ſtand,</hi> Prov. 19. 21.

               <p>
                  <hi>Wherefore lay apart all filthineſs and ſuperfluity of naughtineſs, and receive with meekneſs the ingrafted word which is able to ſave your Souls,</hi> Jam. 1. 21. The Scriptures (as aforeſaid) have proved an occaſion of deceits, that was when Men did abuſe and pervert them of ſet purpoſe; but if made uſe of as here directed, they do diſcover them all, and lead into the way of Truth. <hi>Do ye not therefore err, becauſe ye know not the Scriptures?</hi> ſaid our Lord to the Sadducees, <hi>Mark</hi> 12. 24. But who call themſelves his follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the Roman Church fallaciouſly conclude; therefore Men err, becauſe they know the Scriptures: But this happens only through the abomination of the wicked, <hi>which ſtumble at the word, being diſobedient,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 8. Whereas no truly honeſt minded Soul was ever deceived by it; I do not mean in every little Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion which Miniſters unto ſtrife rather then Godly Edifying, or in matters of doubtful diſputation; but what is neceſſary to build
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:46484:136"/> up in our holy Faith, and make for good Life. As long as we keep our heart whole with God, and continue ſtedfaſt in his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, we are ſafe; but if we once let in a ſinful gain or luſt, then fooliſh imaginations come in, and we are in danger to miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry in the errour of our own ways. If our Selves will take heed, both pray and endeavour to hold up our goings in Gods paths, this is to keep from the paths of the deſtroyer. <hi>If there be no wicked way in us, we ſhall be in the way everlaſting;</hi> Thoſe which turn aſide are Sin and Satan, but this is the Covenant performed in theſe dayes; <hi>That he would grant unto us that we being deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered out of the hands of our Enemies, might ſerve him without fear, in Holineſs and Righteouſneſs before him all the dayes of our Life,</hi> Luke 1. 73, 74. It can be no little ſatisfaction to be freed from danger; and then if it be any comfort to have true quietneſs of Spirit, Joy in the Holy Ghoſt, firm hopes of Eternal Life, ſuch have all theſe. When thoſe who cheriſh themſelves with deceits, may be like the reſt of Sleep, whereof nothing is perceived but interrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; They have no delights in the inward Man, no rejoycings in God; but feed upon groundleſs expectations, which ſhall periſh with them. <hi>If any man think himſelf to be ſomething, when he is nothing, he deceiveth himſelf;</hi> He may indeed with ſlight curſory thoughts conclude his condition to be well enough, this a ſelf deceiver may do. Whereas the true ſervant of God can deſcend into the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of his heart, can <hi>prove his own work, and find rejoycing in himſelf alone,</hi> which the other cannot: <hi>Be not deceived, God is not mocked, for whatſoever a man ſoweth that he ſhall alſo reap; He that ſoweth to his fleſh, ſhall of the fleſh reap corruption, but he that ſoweth to the Spirit, ſhall of the Spirit reap life everlaſting,</hi> Gal. 6. 3, 6, 7, 8.</p>
               <p>Many people intend well, but the Enemy doth try all means to hinder. His firſt attempt is to keep off from coming into the way of Righteouſneſs at all; but if he doth not ſucceed there, he will try to turn them aſide into the By-paths of errour or wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Is God to be Worſhipped? He repreſents ſuch an Idolatry or Heathen Superſtition which he hath got to be retained by one half of thoſe who are called Chriſtians. Is the truth to be ſought after? There is ſuch a falſe light, go after that. Hath the Lord commanded <hi>to do all his Statutes,</hi> Deut. 6. 24. He knoweth ſuch a thing to be for your Happineſs, and why ſhould he reſtrain you from that? Beloved do not give credit to him, who after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner

Foreſooth, they will not keep his Commandments; then they ſhall loſe Eternal Life, and for Diſobedience be caſt into a Furnace of Fire. Who think it ſuch an advantage to have full liberty and follow their own humour in all things, how will they like to be tied down in Chains of Darkneſs, and to pine a whole Eternity in deſires which ſhall not be granted? God will not force them, or any elſe (tho' he might) to his obedience; but will compel tranſgreſſors to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:46484:137"/> the ſeverity of his juſt judgment. In the midſt of ſinning they have a ſecret dread and horrour thereof, which unleſs they did endeavour to ſtifle, would be intolerable to them; let them pretend or talk what they will, or conceal it ſtill, none fear ſo much as thoſe who do not fear God. They being kept in from the World to come (wherein he will ſuffer their evil deeds no longer) only by this vail of fleſh, they are afraid of every leaſt Evil or Sickneſs which may endanger that; and yet by propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his Name, they increaſe their own ſad expectation: They im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>againe they talk big, but do not conſider he is a Great God. It is a ſad thing to conſider that an <hi>Oſtler, Porter,</hi> or other common Perſon, who dare not give a Saucy Word to their Superiours on Earth for fear of having his bones broke, yet ſhould be ſo bold with the moſt High God, who can tear him in pieces, and there is none to deliver him.

               <p>For their liberty to follow all exceſs, to be drunk with good Liquor and good Company is reckoned by ſome to be worth all the luſts of the fleſh, becauſe it is of longer continuance. Yet this doth not laſt always; for labour and other affairs of life call of, they have ſome ſober times; and then what thoughts are in their mind? Call to remembrance all thy former Drunken Fits and merry Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, What ſatisfaction doth now remain? What pleaſure doſt thou perceive of thoſe Cups, thou haſt taken off in all thy paſt Years? In the time of Health and Enjoyment thoſe delights are vaniſhed like Smoke, and ſeem as if they had never been; much more will they appear ſo when you come to lie upon a Death-bed. Indeed you may before that have ſeveral other jovial Fellowſhips, but they will likewiſe paſs away as the former have done; all will come to an end, and there will be ſo much the more guilt to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer for. Several Drunkards to thy knowledge are already dead and gone, and it will be a ſad thing to be in roll of thoſe who <hi>ſhall not inherit the Kingdom of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 6. 10.</p>
               <p>The wicked Man doth falſly think that Death ſhall make an ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter end of him, for as ſure as <hi>Mat. 25. 32. John 5. 28, 29. 2 Cor.</hi> 5. 10. and all Scripture is true, ſo certainly is he deceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his expectation; for he muſt ariſe to Judgment, and if he ſtill continueth in his hard and impenitent heart (as there are ſo many plagues and threatnings, which ſhould move him with all
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:46484:137"/> ſpeed to be converted and eſcape) he muſt remain a living Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Eternal Vengeance. He might all one conclude the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens and Earth ſhould be diſſolved, though (the Son of God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept) the death of millions of millions hath not in the leaſt ſhaked them, as imagine he ſhall not come forth to a fearful Judgment. Perſwade thy ſelf what thou wilt, but as ſure as God made us, and not we our ſelves, as he hath power over us, and we once ſtand here upon the Earth, ſo certainly will he account with us for our doings in another place: Men take up with the common ſaying of Mortality, <hi>an end and no more,</hi> which yet is falſe as themſelves ſhall know. In this as in other things, they ſpeak according to their wiſh, and not according to their real thoughts; The ſenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al intemperate perſon would fain it might be ſo with him, that as the Beaſts die ſo he might die; who made himſelf like them in his life by having no underſtanding, by gorging with the Dog ready to the Vomit, and in his ſottiſh moodes wallowing as a Sow in the Mire, ſo he would his death might not be divided from them; for thy part, thou doſt endeavour and deſire to be like them in both: The former was in thy power, and thou didſt ſo; the latter is not, for God hath decreed otherwiſe: ſuch are to be reſerved to his juſt Judgment.</p>
               <p>What was it for which he muſt be liable to all this? When he was in the moſt flouriſhing condition and did prove himſelf daily with Mirth, this did not ſatisfie him. His heart was dull and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, when he did ſeem chearful to outward appearance, he found but little ſincere joy, but few delights which were not attended with inward damp and ſorrow; if any, they were quickly over and gone. Hardly the tenth part of his ſhort life was ſpent in Jollity; for deduct Child-hood, the time of going to School, ſleep, and neceſſary buſineſs of the World, there is little remaining to enjoy the pleaſures of ſin; if conſidered ſtrictly, they do not extend to the hundredth (I ſhould not be found a great liar i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="258" facs="tcp:46484:138"/> or get higher. He toiled all his life time, and got no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of true ſatisfaction; What profit is it to ſpend our days in Heavineſs, and after Death to look for Puniſhment? Many trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles did befall him, vexation upon vexation, ſorrow upon ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, in his declining years ſeldom a day without grief or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content. In the midſt whereof he cannot tell whither to reſort for true eaſe or comfort; many a ruful exclamation within him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: Why came I forth into the World? It had been better for me to have remained what I was an hundred years ſince, to have never ſeen the light of the living. My life is irkſome and grievous, and I know nothing to the contrary, but when I die it will be yet worſe; fain I would not live, but I fear to die. O that I might ſleep for evermore, or return into my firſt nothing, and then welcome the Grave; I would as willingly lie down there as in a bed of Roſes, but my heart can give no ſuch aſſurance: It ſeems to foreſhew more and greater miſery, when the breath is gone out of my body; I could ſometimes ſay there would be an end of me, but I tremble it will be no ſuch thing. O wretched Man that I am! Who can deliver me from preſent grief, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve me from that expectation of worſe things to come?</p>
               <p>Thus may be ſeen his ſad condition, and indeed it would make an heart of ſtone compaſſionate him, and guſh into Tears; but it is conſidered, all this is come upon him through his own fault, for his contempt and ſtubbornneſs againſt our Moſt Gracious God.

               <p>But let others ſee and fear, what his ungodlineſs is come unto; If one behaves himſelf Proudly and Rebelliouſly againſt the King, who received maintenance and continual favour from him, and comes to ſuffer for it, the voice of the Multitude is, Hang him, he is an ungrateful Traytor. And then if one acts in like manner againſt God, who is loving to every Man, ſendeth Rain upon the

If theſe people become wretched through their own wilfulneſs and perverſeneſs, and if the Holy Almighty God to frighten us the more from it, and to keep up his Government, hath ordered that Miſery ſhould be link<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on to iniquity, and they commit this with greedineſs; Who <note place="margin">Ezek. 14. 22, 23.</note> can be moved or find fault if they have that alſo, which is <hi>juſtly the due reward of their deeds,</hi> Luke 23. 41.

Though there would have been joy among Angels and all good Men if they had repented, who would likewiſe have done any thing to bring it to paſs, and were grieved becauſe they would not ſuffer it; But ſeeing they continued obſtinate, and hardned their hearts, theſe ſhall not pity their Calamity, nor be greived when their fear cometh, which will be a further aggravation. <hi>Many ſorrows ſhall be to the Wicked: But he that truſteth in the Lord, mercy ſhall compaſs him about,</hi> Pſal. 32. 10.</p>

Let the Wicked reckon it a Priviledge that they care not for God (it hath been ſhewed to be a miſerable one) but the Righteous count it their greateſt honour that <hi>God is not aſhamed to be called their God,</hi> Heb. 11. 16. And they poor Earth-Worms, may be ſtiled his Servants. They by Faith ſeeing him that is inviſible, who doth not deſpiſe theſe little ones, however low in the World, are rapt up with admiration; Lord! what are we, that thou ſhouldſt be mindful of us? For conſider how great he muſt be, who made the World and all things therein; how Glorious, whoſe is the Sun and Brightneſs thereof. Others may go and pleaſe themſelves with their acquaintance with Lords and Gentlemen, but we will remember the Name of the Lord our God; who humbleth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to behold the things in Heaven and Earth, yet admits us to come boldly to the Throne of Grace, to preſent our Petitions, which he will grant if he knoweth what is good for us better then

Thoſe of Authority in this World ſay to thoſe under them, go, and he goeth, come, and he cometh, to this Man, do this, and he doth it; much more may the Lord and Governour of the whole World, unto whom the Nations of the Earth are as the drop of a Bucket, command us to do whatſoever pleaſeth him. But as he is Powerful, ſo he is Merciful; he hath ſhewed what he doth require of us, cauſed it to be noted in a Book that it may be for the time to come for ever, and hath <hi>teſtified that no Man add unto theſe things,</hi> Rev. 22. 18. So we are not left at an uncertainty how we may, or when we have done the will of God, if we are in a readineſs ſtill to hear all things that are commanded and made known from his Word.

               <p>There is a delight in approaching to God; thoſe rejoycings which the devout Soul hath, ſeem ſtrange to the unexperienced, for they make no outward noiſe, yet are as real as ſenſual pleaſures to Worldly Men. <hi>He calls the Sabbath a delight, not doing his own Ways, nor finding his own Pleaſure, nor ſpeaking his own Words,</hi> Iſa. 58. 13. It is the moſt pleaſant day of all the Week; rejoycing at this time of Vacation from worldly cares and labour, but more eſpecially becauſe he can wait on the Lord in the Sanctuary; hear his Word: When he comes home, he is better pleaſed with good Conference, Prayer, Reading and Meditation, then others are in vain Talk, wretched Idleneſs, or Recreations; for to them ſuccced Heavineſs in that they have not done what they ſhould. But with a good Man the day ends in Satisfaction, that he hath done his duty by rightly uſing the means of Grace, he hath laid up in the Treaſure of his Heart ſome good things, which may carry him through Temptation, and give comfort the week following. He hath refreſhed himſelf from bodily labour, ſo he can fall to it again more cheerfully; The goodneſs of God is here to be obſerved, how <hi>the Sabbath was made for Man, and not Man for the Sabbath,</hi> Mark 2. 27. For if he were to labour every day, it would be intolerable and irkſome: But now it is not, becauſe a day of reſt returns ſo often, which alſo takes off from the tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of the Year. Since it is thus ordained, the time of Mans labour paſſeth on more comfortably; and there is more variety: in the weck he is cumbred about getting neceſſaries for this miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable

                  <p>A Survey in General of thoſe ſins which hinder the Happineſs of Mankind, as contrary to Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and from the very nature of Things.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>HItherto hath been ſhewed out of Gods Word what is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of Man in every ſtate and condition, and what is moſt for his own Happineſs. Nothing can be done too much to further this great end; and therefore it is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to proceed unto the diſcovery of thoſe things, which promiſe and make a ſhew of Happineſs, but in truth hinder from obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Every ſingle perſon propoſes to himſelf ſome Felicity, which is the end of his Actions: Now the miſtake is, wherein this Happineſs of Man is placed; Whether in obedience to Gods Commandments; or taking the full of the things of this World, following his own inclinations and humours.</p>
               <p>God hath given Laws to his Creatures, the tranſgreſſion of which is Sin. As ſoon as the World was peopled, <hi>the Wickedneſs of Man was great in the Earth, and every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually: for all fleſh had corrupted his way upon the Earth.</hi> Gen. 6. 5, 12. Evil hath interwoven it ſelf into every particle of his Nature; he is become ſtrangely in love there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, not knowing or rather not minding that like a ſweet Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon cauſes Sickneſs and Death, ſo this brings Miſery and Ruine: The fault is wholly in himſelf, for he will be ignorant; Love is blind according to the Proverb, and alſo it prejudices. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution is not to part with, and ſo ſhuts the Eyes, ſtops the Ears, not ſuffering himſelf to be perſwaded of its Deformity and Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief; Sin hath ſtole away the hearts of the Men of this World, it kiſſes and flatters, inſinuating what a deal of good it will do them, what pleaſure it affords.</p>

                  <hi>By one Man ſin entred into the World,</hi> Rom. 5. 12. It pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed upon him after ſuch a colloguing and creeping manner; We may blame our Fore-Father for putting the Seeds of evil in, but yet by the aſſiſtance given us, we may ſtop the growth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. Sin hath this Advantage, that it hath taken Root, and hath one part, even our dear fleſh to ſide with it: Which as ſo much dung and ſoil makes it ſhoot forth abundantly, yet ſtill as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears above ground we may cut it off. And if we alwayes keep it thus ſhort, it may indeed and will ſomewhat trouble us as long as we remain in this ſinful Earth, but it will not overcome or tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph over us. <hi>Let not ſin reign in your Mortal Body,</hi> Rom. 6. 12. The Apoſtle well knew what <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e ſaid in calling it a Mortal Body; If abſolutely without ſin, it could not be Mortal, for Death is by reaſon of Sin: But he further explains himſelf, <hi>verſe 14. Sin ſhall not have dominion over you, for ye are not under the Law, but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Grace.</hi> 'Tis the Dominion and Power of ſin which is really and finally hurtful; from that any one may be freed who will come unto Chriſt. <hi>Without me ye can do nothing,</hi> John 15. 5. And again, <hi>We can do all things through Chriſt that ſtrengthneth us,</hi> Phil. 4. 13. Men are naturally apt to give back, yea, and corruption hath ſo weakned them that they cannot go unto him; <hi>No Man can come unto me, except the Father which ſent me draw him,</hi> John 6. 44. And if any will ſeek unto God for this purpoſe, he will powerfully move and incline them to be followers after Chriſt: When one is brought over to a thing with great ſtriving and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingneſs, it is a common ſaying that he is compelled, though at laſt he yields to it freely; compare <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. with <hi>Luke</hi> 14. 23. And ſo God doth work by his Spirit upon the untoward hearts of Men; He gives Grace, and corruption is there alſo, and theſe ſtruggle together within the Man. Though corruption hath the ſtart of being there before, and doth influence; yet Grace ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows cloſe at the heel, <hi>hath power with God, and with Men, and will prevail.</hi> But the Queſtion is with which the Man will ſide and take part; whether he will <hi>work together with the Grace of</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2 Cor. 6. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>God,</hi> or yield to his own corruptions, and ſo receive that in vain. He cannot be neu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="267" facs="tcp:46484:142"/> doth not, from him ſhall be taken away that which he hath. An old hardned Sinner bred up in ungodlineſs from his Youth, is as awkward to Prayer or good Duties, as a ſtone to flie upwards; yet in his life time paſt had Diſpoſition and Power to do thoſe things, unto which now he is averſe. So he who hath little and few good motions, yet if he doth cheriſh and comply with theſe from time to time, he will have them greater and more impul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive; The Spirit of God is a delicate thing, and cannot endure to be <hi>vexed:</hi> who <hi>rebell</hi> againſt its dictates and thwart its deſires, do provoke him to with-draw. What paſſionate intreaties doth <note place="margin">Iſa. 63. 10.</note> he make to reclaim ſinners? <hi>O! that my people had hearkened unto me, and</hi> Iſrael <hi>had walked in my wayes,</hi> Pſal. 81. 13. <hi>Yea, I have loved thee with an everlaſting love: therefore with loving-kindneſs have I drawn thee,</hi> Jer. 31. 3. Some are moved by this, and others are of ſuch baſe nature as to reſiſt it. <hi>And the Spirit, and the Bride ſay, Come; and let him that heareth ſay, come; and let him that is A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thirſt, come, and whoſoever will, let him take the water of life freely,</hi> Rev. 22. 17. Here is Conſcience, Chriſt, his Miniſters, the want and deſire of good and comprehenſively all other motives which invite; but none is forced for all.</p>
               <p>If they will come, they ſhall be kindly received; but if they make light of all theſe Meſſengers, going their Wayes one to his Farm, another to his Merchandize, at their peril be it. The reaſon why they did, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. was becauſe they had ſome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent buſineſs which they thought of more concern then the Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Dinner: In like manner Men will not entertain the offers of Grace and Salvation made to them out of the Goſpel, becauſe they have ſome luſts and covetous deſires to gratifie, which they think tend more to their Happineſs, then the others. That theſe have ſome delight they are ſure, for they have it in hand, but they cannot conceive any in the other, it is to be revealed here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after they know not when; ſo in their Opinion they make the better choice, becauſe they are certain of ſomething, whereas o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers expoſe themſelves to ſelf-denial and preſent loſſes, and live upon imaginary expectancies. There is no time like the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; a ſlight vanity now is to be prefered before a ſubſtantial Glory hereafter. Moſt excellent reaſoning! and agreeable <hi>to the Wiſdom of this World, that come to nought,</hi> 1 Cor. 2. 6. It is worthy of, and ſuch as could be expected from Men who have no foreſight of things to come: in other things it is prudence to
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:46484:143"/> have an eye forward, but in this (which is of greater Moment then all things put together) <hi>to paſs on and be puniſhed</hi> is reckoned the wiſer way. Then it will be diſcerned otherwiſe, but this is the miſery when they ſhall come to be throughly convinced of their fooliſhneſs, it will be paſt remedy. This objection againſt the things of God becauſe they are to come, hath been already anſwered; And for the delight of the ſins moſt in eſteem and p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

It may appear very ſmall and inconſiderable, for which a Man muſt loſe Temporal Comfort and Eternal Joyes, endure the manifold evils and inconveniencies of ſin in this preſent time, and afterwards ſuffer endleſs Torment. To be excluded from Peace here, and Glory hereafter; to be made ſubject unto ſorrows now, and hence forwards Eternal anguiſh of mind, muſt be preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial to Mans Happineſs, or nothing is.</p>
               <p>All this is to lay ſtronger engagement on us to obſerve Gods Laws; <hi>In keeping of them there is great reward,</hi> Pſal. 19. 11. There is happineſs to be found; but in tranſgreſſion is exceeding puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, there only miſery is felt. The way of God is a way of Peace, as long as any one walks therein he is ſafe, but if he turns his foot aſide, he preſently falls into trouble and danger. Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and Happineſs are met together, Righteouſneſs and Peace have kiſſed each other: As again, Sin and Miſery are coupled, Wickedneſs and Puniſhment are joyned hand in hand.</p>

                  <hi>The Heavens declare the Glory of God: and the Firmament ſheweth his handy work. Day unto Day uttereth Speech, Night unto Night</hi>

The aſtoniſhing Works of creation proclaim aloud to all the World, there is a God who made them: The excellent contrivance of this glorious Fabrick, doth ſhew forth his great Power and infinite Underſtanding. But they do not make known what the Lord requireth of us; they do not reveal in what relation we ſtand towards him, they cannot diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver our imperfection, or how we may pleaſe and become like unto him; they do not ſhew the errour of our crooked and perverſe wayes, or manifeſt the true Happineſs, or how we may run to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it, and not at uncertainty: Neither doth they preſcribe how to remedy our natural folly and blindneſs. <hi>But the Law of the Lord is perfect, converting the Soul: the Teſtimony of the Lord is

                  <hi>The Prophecy came not in Old time by the Will of Man, but holy men of God ſpake as they were moved by the holy Ghoſt,</hi> 2 Pet. 1. 21. <hi>God who at ſundry times, and in divers manners, ſpake in time paſt unto the Fathers by the Prophets, hath in theſe laſt days ſpoken unto us by his Son,</hi> Heb. 1. 1, 2. Who whilſt he dwelt amongſt us, made known the Will of his heavenly Father, chuſing unto him Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples to go and teach likewiſe. He inſtructed them until the time of his Suffering: <hi>To whom he ſhewed himſelf alive after his Paſſion by many infallible Proofs, being ſeen of them forty days, and ſpeaking of the things pertaining to the Kingdom of God. And being aſſembled toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with them, commanded that they ſhould not depart from</hi> Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, <hi>but wait for the Promiſe of the Father, which ſaith he, ye have heard of me,</hi> Acts 13. 4. It was the <hi>Comforter, which is the holy Ghoſt, whom my Father will ſend in my Name, he ſhall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance whatſoever I have ſaid unto you,</hi> John 14. 26. Many things Chriſt did and ſaid, which are not written by the Evangeliſts, ſome whereof the Apoſtles have delivered. And other things they have laid down out of his Doctrine by infallible inference and deduction. They could not be miſtaken, for they received the Promiſe, <hi>John 16. 13. The Spirit of Truth will guide you into all Truth;</hi> and for a manifeſt Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony thereof, they foretold things to come, which have been, and are to be fulfilled.</p>
               <p>In the old Teſtament <hi>the Law of Moſes,</hi> the <hi>Prophets,</hi> and the <hi>Pſalms</hi> ſo ſummed up, <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 44.

By theſe God will judge us at the laſt day. <hi>I ſaw the Dead ſmall and great ſtand before God, and the Books were opened, and another Book was opened, which was the Book of Life, and the Dead were judged out of thoſe things, which were written in the Books according to their Works,</hi> Rev. 20. 12.

               <p>In Chriſt's Sermon on the Mount, before he comes to ſpeak as to the Commandments, he doth premiſe: <hi>Think not that I am come

As for the Types and Ceremonies they were but Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figurations of him that was to come, ſo they vaniſh when all was finiſhed on the Croſs. Other Statutes did relate to the <hi>Jews</hi> in their politick capacity, which <hi>Moſes</hi> did ordain from God, who was to them immediately inſtead of a Temporal King <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

He introduces it, <hi>Except your Righteouſneſs exceed the Righteouſneſs of the</hi> Scribes <hi>and</hi> Phariſees, <hi>ye ſhall in no caſe enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> And then he doth explain the true meaning and full extent of the Commandments. He hath alſo filled up the Defects and Imperfections of the Law, hath rendred it holy and ſpiritual. By making more known how it did reach the inward man, was a diſcerner of the thoughts and intents of the Heart: for out of that did proceed the things which defile the man, and therefore ſhould be rightly ordered. He enjoyned Purity and Sincerity of Heart, which in Scripture language ſignifies the Spirit or Soul, with all its Operations and Faculties, the whole man. Indeed the ſame was required of old; but then both Prieſt and People did draw near to God with their Lips, placing all their Religion in outward Performances, (the like miſtake is too common in theſe days) againſt which the Prophets in ſundry places boldly declare the Word of God, for which faithful dealing they were ſtoned, killed, ſawed aſunder, and their Writings were not much hearkned unto; for the rebellious People were reſolved to go on in their courſe. There was no Prophet among them for four hundred Years before the coming of Chriſt, in which ſpace the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nation had corrupted their Way, and thoſe intruſted to preach <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, proved moſt unfaithful; for by their own Traditions they made the Commandments of God of none effect. But he hath reſtored again the true Doctrine and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrupted Word of God, and hath reſcued many poor and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:46484:144"/> Souls from blind Leaders. This was one end of Chriſt's coming into the World, but the principal one was of offering his Soul a ſacrifice for Sin, and eſtabliſhing a more gracious Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, as is particularly ſet forth in the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thou art the God that doſt Wonders, thou haſt declared thy ſtrength among the People; thou haſt with thine Arm redeemed thy People, the Sons of</hi> Jacob <hi>and</hi> Joſeph, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 77. 14. 15, Theſe things thou didſt of Old; but ſince thou haſt magnified thy power by <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus of</hi> Nazareth, <hi>a man approved of God by Miracles, and Wonders, and Signs, which God did by him</hi> (and as a further Confirmation of all) <hi>God hath raiſed him up, having looſed the Pains of Death,</hi> Acts 2. 22, 24. <hi>And declared to be the Son of God with Power, according to the Spirit of Holineſs, by the Reſurrection from the Dead,</hi> Rom. 1. 14. Thereby witneſſing all which he ſaid was true. And now ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving done ſo great things for us, whereof we rejoyce, he is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed not to multiply Miracles. It is his decree <hi>we ſhould walk by Faith,</hi> and not by ſight, and we have ſufficient for the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that. It was the ſaying of Father <hi>Abraham, If they hear not</hi> Moſes <hi>and the Prophets;</hi> but now ſince the Author of the New Teſtament hath ſuffered, and that is become of force by his death, it may be added, <hi>If they hear not Chriſt and his Apoſtles, neither will they be perſwaded, though one roſe from the dead,</hi> Luke 16. 31. For this would not be half ſo wonderful as what they did; and if men will not be perſwaded by what is greater, if they will not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve ſo many ſtrange Works, and ſuch a cloud of Witneſſes, above five hundred Brethren at once, which had ſeen Chriſt after he was riſen, neither will they give credit unto a ſingle Perſon that came from the Grave and teſtified of theſe things. Men are apt to think and with in their Hearts, that they had greater Evidence and full Aſſurance that theſe things are ſo; but that cannot well be, unleſs the fore-mentioned Decree is reverſed, and we did now ſee the things of Heaven with open face. God is not ſuch, as he ſhould lye or repent; neither will he falſify and bring to nought his wiſe Counſels and Deſigns, to gratifie the unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able deſire of ſinful men. We are to be thankful that he hath been pleaſed to reveal himſelf thus far, and not as an evil Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to ſeek yet a ſign, when no ſign ſhall be given, ſaving that of the everlaſting Goſpel. He hath ordered it to be preached <hi>unto all Nations for a witneſs unto them,</hi> which carries with it ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Evidence for convincing all mankind, and to leave them
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:46484:145"/> without excuſe. We ought to reſt ſatisfied, now himſelf hath given the final peremptory Rule. <hi>He that believeth, and is bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, ſhall be ſaved; but he that believeth not, ſhall be damned,</hi> Mark 16. 16. John 3. 36. Whether men believe the Goſpel or not, they ſhall be judged by it: Let not this be thought hard, for God hath power over men; however, there is ſuch certainty in the things contained therein, that People cannot do otherwiſe then believe them, unleſs they renounce even common under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. But they are become corrupt and perverſe by Luſts, which make them unwilling to believe: They would not have God reign over them, and therefore will not receive for truth what he hath revealed. <hi>He that believeth not God, hath made him a Liar, becauſe be believeth not the Record that God gave of his Son,</hi> 1 John 5. 10. God by the puniſhment he will inflict on ſuch, will manifeſt that he is no Lyar, but what he hath ſaid will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from to the utmoſt.</p>
               <p>What is it that moves deſpicable Creatures to offer ſuch an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front to the Moſt High God? Only gratifying of paltry Luſts, or a Baſe Intereſt; which hath ſo bewitched them, that they cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure any thing which contradicts it. And the Goſpel command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the denial of them, which is enforced with Rewards to the Obedient, and Threatnings to thoſe that will not comply, upon this Reaſon ſome being reſolved to keep to their own wicked Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, they ſhew malice againſt it: they will not believe, leſt they ſhould be induced to obey; and thus they provoke the author thereof. But let theſe men know, Greater is he whoſe Word it is, then themſelves who will give no credit thereunto. As he is the <hi>Lord our Righteouſneſs,</hi> Jer. 33. 16. ſo will he be the <hi>Lord taking Vengeance, 2 Theſe.</hi> 1. 8. He hath given a gracious Law; ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe he hath annexed Severity towards thoſe who will not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it. They had need be well aſſured that thoſe things which make a ſeparation between God and themſelves, do counter poize the loſs of his goodneſs and favour, and make amends for the power of his anger: But are they equivalent to the leaſt of his Mercies? Or will they take off the ſmart, when his Wrath is kindled but a little? They ſhould fully conſider, whether thoſe things God forbids, and they will do, can yield them more content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and ſatisfaction in proportionable degree and duration, then the things he commands, and they refuſe; otherwiſe their Diſobedience will be moſt unreaſonable and fooliſh: for they
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:46484:145"/> loſe exceeding and eternal happineſs, and expoſe themſelves to the like miſery. Certainly all the Enjoyments of this preſent time cannot make recompence for the torments to be revealed hereafter; but what if it ſhould be ſaid further? The pleaſures of Sin for a ſeaſon, even whilſt that ſeaſon is, do deprive of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter happineſs then they bring; and men are made more miſerable by them. In the very time they are ſo eagerly followed and had, it would be better if the man had not uſed them. If it can be made evidently to appear that living according to the Goſpel renders more happy in this Life, then taking the full ſwinge of Licentiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and beſides, there is the conſideration of a different futu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, then it will be clearly demonſtrated, that there's no ſuch Fool as the Sinner. And God is moſt gracious in providing ſo well for mankind; and they <hi>without cauſe</hi> are malicious, evil, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudent <note place="margin">Pſal. 25. 3.</note> and ſtubborn, in not complying with his Grace and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. With the greateſt Reaſon and Equity, <hi>Judgments are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for Scorrers, and Stripes for the back of Fools,</hi> Prov. 19. 29. What more could have been done to bring men unto Heaven, then by ſo ordering the matter that they ſhall be more happy in going the way to it, then they could in the broad way that leads to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction?</p>

Such we ſhould be our ſelves, look pitiful and little not worthy to be accounted of. And then he makes no ſuch Proffers of preſent advantage, but Talks of Self-denial, cutting of ones right hand, hating Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Mother, and abundance of hard ſayings; ſo that who would come unto him?

               <p>It hath been the ſubtlety of Satan, who ſetteth up his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom againſt that of Chriſt, to get the multitude over to his ſide, and to make an outward appearance of Happineſs. Thus he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwades Men to that which is neither right nor good: In the great Temptation to Drunkenneſs, he is not wanting to ſuggeſt all the Conveniencies thereof, but the Evils are cunningly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed. As it frees from Care and Sorrow, removes heavineſs from the Heart, making that light and cheerful. It takes away Fear and every thing that vexes: Eſpecially it doth pacifie thoſe grumblings of Conſcience, which is imagined a mighty Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; for as thoſe are irkſome and grievous, ſo it can be no ſmall Comfort to be freed from them. And then it exceeds all other Pleaſures, becauſe of longer continuance. Other ſinful Delights are quickly vaniſhed, but Drunkenneſs doth endure for a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable time, all is Mirth and Jollity. What Delight can be compared to this, which may be had every day, and takes up the greater part thereof? Who but a moroſe ill natured Fellow would not oblige Company upon ſuch pleaſant and eaſie Terms? Doth he not deſerve to be thruſt from the Fellowſhip of mankind, who will not comply with them in a thing ſo much for their Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs?

If they will follow after thoſe means themſelves have choſen, they will be certainly deceived. Sin hath this advantage that it looſes nothing for want of ſetting of; if out ward ſhew and noiſe (as this is the Rule whereby the World judge) will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend a thing, there is ſufficient. <hi>Look not upon the VVine when it is Red, when it giveth his Colour in the Cup, when it moveth it ſelf aright, at laſt it biteth like a Serpent, and ſtingeth like an Adder,</hi> Prov. 23. 31, 32. <hi>VVine is a Mocker, ſtrong drink is raging, and whoſoever is deceived thereby is not VViſe,</hi> Prov. 20. 1.

               <p>Conceive it altogether in the Beginning, Middle, End, with its further conſequents.

By degrees, that relu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctancy and Aukwardneſs goes of, the Body becomes diſpoſed to receive ſuch a quantity without foregoing qualm or diſturbance: And then is Pleaſure in the beginning of the Sin: Yet that paſt trouble is to be put in the Scale over againſt it. Now it is ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual and eaſie. Here again conſtancy takes off the Delight, for if one daily partakes of choice things, he loſes the Savour of them. It is granted, that the Pleaſantneſs doth not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in the drink, but that is in the Effects thereof. By giving a preſent Freedom from Evils and Enjoyment of Mirth, unleſs the Man is dead Drunk, the fancied Happineſs of whom is the ſame with that of a dead Palſie, which is not ſenſible of Pain. But in the leſſer Act thereof is diſcovery of Shame, Folly, and Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. It is deſcribed, <hi>Prov.</hi> 23. 33, 34, 35.

How many have we heard to have killed themſelves with Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, who have burnt up their own Vital Spirits with the greater heat of Liquors, and by innumerable Accidents have been haſtily cut off, and all occaſioned through Intemperance. <hi>Job</hi> calls it <hi>their Deſtruction,</hi> for themſelves are the Author of it; and is not God diſpleaſed with Mens doings after this manner?</p>

If any hath a real love and compaſſion for Mankind, he is not to be blamed if he doth uſe the moſt plain and obvious expreſſions, to prevent thoſe evils which come upon them by their Sin and Folly. <hi>Any words are more tolerable then to ſuffer the thing it ſelf;</hi> Several will find fault with this way of Writing uſed in this Chapter eſpecially; But they are deſired to conſider likewiſe, how the ſtile of Scripture runs exactly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to thoſe Times when it was firſt Penned, and that is

If others think that here it <note place="margin">Pſal. 119. 42.</note> hath been varied from, when thoſe common ſayings and excuſes were inſerted which are not to be found in the <hi>Word,</hi> yet there it is ſaid, <hi>Anſwer a fool according to his fully leaſt he be wiſe in his</hi>

We have aſſurance, that one time (yet to come) <hi>All iniquity ſhall ſtop her Mouth,</hi> Pſal. 107. 42. The means to accompliſh which is to take off that Colour and Varniſh of Reaſon, to diſcover that plauſible ſhew of Wit with which Men countenance their Sin. <hi>For he flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth himſelf in his own ſight, until his Iniquity ſhall be found to be hateful,</hi> Pſal. 36. 2. Which hath been here ſomewhat mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted according to the Ability God hath given.</p>
               <p>Let the Mad and Frantick World pauſe for a while; why, you may continue Men ſtill, and yet go in another way: You may ſtill retain the ſame Affections and Deſires, and have them at preſent in a good manner contented; however, you may refrain for a little while from the full Gratification of them. You are now all for good Drink, the preſcribed Meaſure is now much better then exceſs, but for further encouragement Our Lord ſaid juſt before his Paſſion, <hi>I will drink no more of the fruit of the Vine, until that day that I drink it new in the Kingdom of God,</hi> Mark 14. 25. <hi>And in this Mountain ſhall the Lord of Hoſts make unto all People a Feaſt of fat Things, a Feaſt of Wines on the lees, of fat things full of Marrow, of Wines on the lees well refined,</hi> Iſa. 25. 6 Indeed, ſuch groſs and ſenſual Pleaſures are not to be expected in Heaven as reſult from Eating and Drinking; even here it is ſaid <hi>well refined:</hi> But undoubtedly others will be ſubſtituted in the Room, which ſhall more refreſh then theſe do now, according to what ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Prophet ſaith, <hi>Their heart ſhall rejoyce as through Wine, their heart ſhall rejoyce in the Lord,</hi> Zech. 10. 7. It ſhall give us alike ſatisfaction as Wine doth now, but as much greater and of longer continuance as the Infinite and everlaſting God in whom all fulneſs dwells, doth exceed that lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and empty delight which is now to be had from the Creature. The Spirit of God condeſcends to our Infirmity, and exhorts to his Obedience by promiſing the ſame things
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:46484:158"/> which we now eagerly deſire after. Who is all for pleaſant Drink, hath the very ſame invitation to follow after the things of his Kingdom. If the Drunkard will leave off his ſinful Courſes, he ſhall find more content and leſs inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency; moreover exceeding great and Eternal Happineſs here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
               <p>Perhaps he will ſay, he hath been ſo long uſed to it that he cannot. Indeed a wicked habit is not quickly or eaſily ſhaken off; it crept on by degrees, and will ſtick cloſe, but there is an abſolute neceſſity. <hi>Except ye repent, ye ſhall periſh,</hi> twice aſſerted, <hi>Luke</hi> 13. And that is a through change of mind and reformation of Life; if he hath been guilty of Drunkenneſs, let him ask Pardon for it, and be ſo no more. Seek for the Grace of God, which is ſufficient to ſubdue the power of this or any Sin. The Man muſt be ſure ſincerely to labour together therewith, and endeavour to be freed from Sottiſhneſs the ſame way he got it; let him daily deny himſelf ſomewhat and abridge a little of his wonted Meaſure; by this means he may be at length free from it.</p>
               <p>It is commonly pleaded by him, who lies under a cuſtom of ſin that he cannot forſake it; So he flatters and beguiles his own Soul, that either God will not require him to do an impoſſible thing, and therefore he ſhall be excuſed; or he is an hard Maſter to ſhut a Man out of Heaven and caſt him into Hell for a thing he could not help. But O wicked Servant! Wherefore doſt thou to keep thine own wickedneſs accuſe God fooliſhly and falſly? <hi>For he will not lay upon Man more then right, that he ſhould enter into Judgment with God,</hi> Job 34. 23. <hi>Repent, if peradventure the iniquity of thine heart may be forgiven;</hi> Conſider ſeriouſly, thou alone haſt wilfully brought thy ſelf under the Power and Slavery of Sin. By former hardening thy heart, and not hearing Gods Voice, when thou hadſt more ſtrength, and ſin leſs; At the firſt entrance upon the Practice of it thou couldſt more eaſily have not done, then done it; after thou couldſt refrain with a ſmall irkſomneſs, till ſin at length began to prevail through thine own neglect to reſiſt, and willingneſs to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it. And becauſe it is more difficult to part with, thou concludeſt impoſſible; No habit, however long in contracting
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:46484:159"/> is impoſſible to be removed, it may be done though with difficulty. It cannot be done in an Inſtant, but may in Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of time. There is none ſo far gone in the Diſeaſe of Drunkenneſs or other Sin, but there is hope of Cure; Wherefore thoſe Sinners are required to attend to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 11, 12, 13, 14.

                  <p>Of Adultery, Fornication, Uncleanneſs, Laſciviouſneſs.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THeſe are ſome of thoſe <hi>Works of the Fleſh,</hi> Gal. 5. 19. 21. <hi>Of the which they that do ſuch things ſhall not inherit the Kingdom of God.</hi> But what preſent Good do they bring in recompence of ſo great a Loſs? It is ſurmiſed much, becauſe of the inclination in Mans Nature to theſe Luſts; they do like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe beat ſtrongly upon the outward Senſe, and it ſeems hard he ſhould be reſtrained to gratifie them. It is the moſt intenſe De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light Man enjoys, and why ſhould he not find ſome Pleaſure amidſt ſo many Evils and Miſeries of Life? All Fleſh conſorteth accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to its kind, and muſt Man who hath the ſame Tendency be hindred from it? Were thoſe Deſires put in only to torment him, in that he muſt not Act accordingly? Doth God, to magnifie his Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer and Pleaſure, command him to abſtain from that which by the Law in his Members, he is bound to obey? And then how much Pleaſure and Mirth doth the Diſcourſe thereof afford? More is fancied in the Act and Fruition.</p>
               <p>The preſent Deſign requires to ſet forth Sin in its utmoſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, and there may be other Circumſtances conceived, but allowing for all the Delight thereof; yet this is not that <hi>Good thing, which is ſet before the Sons of Men.</hi> Indeed Sin is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved to the utmoſt: Though its Followers with all their Wit and Contrivance cannot find out any new Pleaſures, yet what they have already they manage with ſo much Skill, that they receive as much Delight from them as poſſibly can be had, and yet all comes ſhort of the <hi>True Happineſs.</hi> As for theſe Fleſhly Luſts, the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and expectation going before, and thoſe Inconveniencies and Evil afterwards, will more then exceed the ſudden Complacency. The Gall is much more then pure Honey, if any is to be found,
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:46484:160"/> which is little, like that <hi>at the end of</hi> Jonathan's <hi>Rod,</hi> 1 Sam. 14. 43.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Many of them which uſed curious Arts, brought the Books together and burnt them before all Men, ſo mightily grew the word of God and prevailed,</hi> Acts 19. 19, 20. And there is the ſame Reaſon ſtill, that thoſe Printed Songs, Romances, Play Books, which propagate Sin in the World, and in an implicit manner (under <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eatheniſh Titles) call to queſtion Gods Juſtice and Truth in giving Laws to mankind, ſhould alſo be burnt, as thoſe are, which contain ſcandalous Reflections upon the King and Goverment: And ſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly they would be thrown into the Flames, if the word of God did now ſo mightily grow and prevail, as it did in thoſe firſt and pureſt times. But ſeeing they are ſtill extant to corrupt the Minds and Manners of People, ſomething is to be ſaid more particularly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Behold in this thou art not juſt, I will anſwer thee, that God is greater then Man: VVhy doſt thou ſtrive againſt him? For he giveth not Account of any of his Matters,</hi> Job 33. 12, 13. He doth more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the greateſt Monarch then this vaſt Globe of the World, a ſingle Duſt of the Ballance; and is not bound to give the leaſt Account of whatever he enjoyns us. <hi>Therefore ſhall ye keep my Commandments, and do them, I am the Lord,</hi> Lev. 22. 31. Preſent and cheerful Obedience is to be paid unto him, without perverſe Diſputings of corrupt Minds. <hi>By Faith</hi> Abraham <hi>when he was called to go out into a place which he ſhould after receive for an Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance obeyed, and went out not knowing whether he went,</hi> Heb. 11. 8, 9. Who believes in God that formed him, if he would be juſtified with faithful <hi>Abraham,</hi> muſt perform his Commands how contrary ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they appear to Fleſh and Blood, if he doth not preſently un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, wherefore the Lord ſhould require ſuch things, as he doth commonly make that known afterwards. The Servant is to do, not to examine the Will of his Maſter. But who <hi>who is like unto the Lord our God, who humbleth himſelf to behold the things that are in Heaven and Earth?</hi> Yet condeſcends to that (which the proud Men of the World will not) as to permit his Servants to <hi>reaſon of his righteous Acts,</hi> 1 Sam. 12. 7. <hi>and to judge of the equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of his ways,</hi> Ezek. 18. 25. and for thoſe who deſpiſe this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Goodneſs, there is ſeverity reſerved in ſtore.</p>
               <pb n="303" facs="tcp:46484:160"/>
               <p>The Caſe in hand ſeems oppoſite to carnal Reaſon, becauſe Fleſh will argue for fleſhly Luſts; nevertheleſs take it not quite away, but only its Prejudice and Corruption; it may put in a lawful Claim without boundleſs or extravagant Deſires, and then Fleſh it ſelf may judge how juſt and reaſonable the Laws of God are. Thoſe natural Inclinations are not reſtrained, but expreſly ordered to be complyed withal, <hi>Gen. 2. 18. Gen. 9. 1. 1 Cor.</hi> 7. 2, 9. This one Expedient vindicates the Juſtice and Goodneſs of God from all thoſe Cavils of Men, walking after their own Luſts. But as he is Soveraign Lord to exerciſe his Kingdom and Dominion over Men, he doth in this as in the other things, allow a lawful Liberty, and is pleaſed further to try our Obedience.</p>
               <p>The Gallants will cry Piſh, a Wife is an irkſome thing to Men of Faſhion. They cannot endure to be confined. The Blood runs warm in their Veins and they are wanton; <hi>When I had fed them to the full, they then committed Adultery, and aſſembled themſelves by Troops in the Harlots Houſes: they were as fed Horſes in the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning every one Neighed after his Neighbours Wiſe,</hi> Jer. 5. 7, 8.

                  </gap>ir Eſtate, but they will not be deprived of wonted Libertiniſm. They hunt out after con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient Objects, not valuing whether they break through another Mans incloſure or ſport in a Common. Are not theſe brisk Men more Happy and better eſteemed of in the World, then thoſe dull Flegmatick Souls who keep the <hi>Marriage Bed undefiled?</hi> Moſt certainly ſuch are of the ſafer ſide as for the time to come, but for the preſent who hath the greater ſhare of Happineſs? It may be judged of, when the ways of the Laſcivious Wanton are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what laid open.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Lord hath been Witneſs between thee and the Wife of thy Youth, againſt whom thou haſt dealt Treacherouſly, yet is ſhe thy Companion and VVife of thy Covenant,</hi> Mal. 2. 14. When a Man proves unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, his Heart is alienated from her who is the conſtant Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of his Bed; for going after Strangers makes affection ceaſe towards his own: Perhaps at firſt it was not ſo much unkindneſs as to gratifie an extravagant Deſire; but the Seeds of hatred are ſown, which ſpring up and embitter their other Delights. Who have ſufficient of outward Bleſſings, yet all is ſpoiled by this one acc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rſed thing. Thoſe mutual Heart-burnings, Diſcontent, ſad Wiſhes and Imprecations take away the Relliſh of other Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. It is very hard on the Womans ſide, that ſhe muſt be
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:46484:161"/> wretched for no fault of her own, but meerly the iniquity and baſeneſs of her Husband; who (according to the uſual Methods of injuſtice) commits a double Tranſgreſſion; Firſt, becomes perfidious, and then conceives Hatred, which laſt is thought an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe of the Sin, when in Truth it is a worſe Aggravation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. If he hath the leaſt Senſe of God above, thoſe ſevere girds and twitches of Conſcience do more then abundantly take off from the Sweetneſs of ſtolen Waters. If he hath any degree of common Nature, he cannot but be moved with his own injury and falſhood towards whom he is bound to give that which is equal, and obſerve the ſolemn Oath and Promiſe between them. Many particulars do ſufficiently ſhew, that he who violates con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugal Chaſtity, procures continued Vexation unto himſelf; and for a few hours running after unlawful Love, he renders the whole Courſe of his Life miſerable: This Truth is ſo diſcernable that more need not to be ſaid thereof. It is not altogether ſo pleaſant for married Men, to follow theſe Luſts of the Fleſh: but the ſingle Perſon who hath none to controul him, who is tyed to none, but at Liberty for all, he finds the pretended good of them.</p>
               <p>But it would be better for him if he let them alone, or have the lawful Remedy. No, no, Crys the young Man. Variety is pleaſant, one time for this, then for another wherever Beauty or Change invite him: At firſt, this kind of Life may ſeem delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, thoſe Preparatives do ſomewhat pleaſe. That obſcene and filthy Talk, laſcivious Songs, wanton Dalliances and rude Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures (for thus the Devils Souldier is trained up and Diſciplined) are a little diverting, till abundant and repeated uſe doth alſo take that away. If the ſtripling hath not caſt off all regard to God and his Worſhip (as that is ſeldom, for the impreſſions are then more ſtrong and ſenſible, and it may be preſerved by good Education of Parents) then his thoughts will be apt to accuſe him. It is not meet, the ſame Tongue wherewith Prayers and Praiſes are offered up unto the Moſt High God, ſhould be defiled with corrupt Communications, or ſinging forth the Encomium of ſin and iniquity. <hi>Therewith to Bleſs God the Father, and therewith to diſhonour him.

Even at preſent a Man diſcovereth himſelf by the Talk of his Mouth; Where proceeds forth Filthineſs and Folly, it is a ſtrong Preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that ſuch is he himſelf. A noble Subject to converſe upon, whereof a Man cannot think without abhorrence. A ſign of an exalted and raiſed Spirit, to depreſs the Mind into a Beaſt: What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever delight ariſes hereby, it is like that of Children or Fools. The great Talkers of this kind, do not pretend to ſuch a mighty degree of Pleaſure from the meer Diſcourſe; that is ſaid to be when Words are reduced into Actions.</p>
               <p>Here lies a rub in the young Mans way, and this helps for remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val thereof. That ſhame and modeſty of Nature is an hindrance to him from doing thus wickedly. He gives back, and had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther let it alone. And therefore this muſt be laid aſide, (which is not done without time and difficulty) before the expected Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction can be had. The mind is ſpoiled of its moſt lovely Ornament before he comes to the doing of thoſe things in ſecret, whereof it is a ſhame to ſpeak. That Virgin bluſh (then which nothing is more beautiful) muſt be gone. Accordingly the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern way of breeding is to drive that away as ſoon as poſſible. It is more eminent in the Female Sex, and was formerly an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, but now eſteemed the effect of Countrey Education, laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at, and by keeping Company with the Town Ladies, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenting the Play houſe it is at length utterly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Is this to <hi>bring up Children in the Nurture and Admonition of the Lord?</hi> Certainly this way doth ſooner lead them to commit all iniquity with Greedineſs, and makes them the <hi>Children of Hell.</hi> Corruption moves quick enough of it ſelf, there is no need of taking away the Clog that he may run more haſtily in the broad way. However it is irk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome to do that, but then he may fall to <hi>committing of Folly;</hi> for ſo the Holy Ghoſt in a peculiar manner calls this Sin. The fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going diſturbance is removed, there ſucceeds another after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
               <pb n="306" facs="tcp:46484:162"/>
               <p>Thoſe qualms of Conſcience immediately after the Fact, are more bitter then the ſweet of the beloved Sin. They are equal in Degree, but longer in Duration. That Horrour and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraction of mind for what is done, thoſe frightful Suggeſtions of having offended God, the Blackneſs of Guilt which comes forth and ſits heavy upon the Soul, Indignation and Anguiſh, all th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Go reſolutely on and he will not find ſuch ſevere reſiſtance. His own experience aſſures him every time he Practiſes it, there is leſs Reluctancy. The raw and unexperienced Souldier is frightned at the ſmoke of Guns, his Heart pants at every Puſh or Charge, but the old Marches on undountedly, and is not troubled with Fears. Never be diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged if a thick Cloud ſhould ariſe in thy mind; do not value eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Dart that ſTrikes through the Liver;</hi> do not fear the aſſaults of the armed Man within thee. The Souldier is ſtrengthened with Brandy, and thou mayſt afterwards reſort to good Liquor to drown Melancholy fancies, Be Patient, reſiſt them, and they will by degrees vaniſh. If thy Acquaintance find thee dejected, they will Laugh at thee; do as they have done, and thou ſhalt be as brisk as they. Such is the Policy of the old Serpent, to get the young beginner into an Habit and Courſe of Sin, for he knoweth this is the way of hardening, and then he is almoſt ſure of a prey. It is acknowledged that Cuſtom will take of the Senſe of this Sin, as appears from <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 19. But this is a long time in gaining, and thoſe ſtruglings in the mean while do annul the Pleaſure of it. Men think themſelves Wiſe and Happy, if they can once come to enjoy their Luſts without interruption, for then they imagine they have nothing to do with <hi>the Powers of the World to come,</hi> but are only for what preſent Pleaſure they can have.

Thence he concludes it impoſſible, and ſo goes on with hope to be excuſed, ſeeing he hath tryed to repent, though he is neither heartily Sorry for what he hath done, nor leaves it of: When formerly he might have refrained from the ſeveral Acts, and ſo by degrees have came to perfect Abhorrency and true Contrition. And now he might keep his Tongue from every filthy and idle Word, confeſs in the bitterneſs of his Soul inſtead of Glorying in his Shame, endeavour all ways to diſſwade others rather then allure them on.

Some through this are diſſemblers with God, who pretend to ſerve him, are zealous for the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Ordinances, and abſtain from the chargeable Sins, but do <hi>grind the Faces of the Poor,</hi> Iſa. 3. 15. Cheat and defraud others, are greedy after Gain and uſe ſinful means. And yet ſeem to have a good mind towards God, for they are diligent in his Worſhip. <hi>And they come unto thee as the People cometh, and they ſit before thee as my People, and they hear thy VVords, but they will not do with them; for with their Mouth they make a ſhew of much Love, but their Heart goeth after their Covetouſneſs,</hi> Ezek. 33. 31. As if they could put a Cheat upon him alſo, by putting him off with good words only, when in the mean time they will think and do what they Liſt. <hi>Thou underſtandeſt my thought afar off,</hi> Pſal. 139. 2. At the very Riſe and Conception before we know it our ſelves. Let this be duly conſidered of by Hyppocrites and formal Profeſſors. It will not be accepted to be double-minded, to have one place for God, and another for the World. Neither is he to be thruſt
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:46484:170"/> out from the Heart into the Mouth or Lips. He knoweth where he is uſed with neglect, and will recompence accordingly, as alſo where he is not <hi>obeyed from the Heart,</hi> and where he hath not the whole. The Commandment is repeated over and over. <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thy Heart, and with all thy Soul.</hi> He requires to have the principal and whole place in Man, nothing to be preferred before him, and all things to be done in ſubſerviency to his Obedience. That which was given to Miniſter, muſt not ſet up for Rule. What he only allowed for Neceſſaries and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences, that he might be ſerved in Holineſs and Righteouſneſs all the days of our Life, is not to come in for the main end, nor be made an occaſion to provoke him by iniquity and diſobedience. How unreaſonable is it, that a little yellow or white Duſt ſhould be preferred before God, who made Heaven and all things there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in? They are accurſed who worſhip the Sun, Moon and Stars, which declare his Glory, but are not to deprive him of the leaſt degree of his own; much leſs may the ſmall things here below. God made us, preſerveth us, gives whatſoever we enjoy, and hath provided an eternal Happineſs hereafter, if we do not by ſuch groſs Demerits as eſteeming every little thing before him (which ſets forth the infinite Aggravation of Sin) forfeit our Right we have to his free and gracious Promiſes. If we might <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Now of God are all things, and therefore to him belong all Love, Fear, Honour, Praiſe, Obedience, and whatſoever we can do to expreſs our utmoſt Acknowledgment and Worſhip of his Divine Majeſty. Let us do as much as we can to acknowledge His Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and Property, and our own Subjection and Dependance. Let us have an exceeding high Opinion of whatever appertains to him, and then we ſhould have but a very little Opinion of all that is here in Compariſon of the <hi>Great things of God.</hi> Even in this wicked partial and idolatrous World, Dung is never pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before Crowns and Scepters: And if the Eyes of our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding were enlightened, and we did lift them up to the everlaſting Hills, we might apprehend ſuch unutterable things there, that we ſhould no more eſteem of the moſt magnified things of this World, then now we do the Stones and Earth we walk upon. But all Men have not Faith, who look upon this as meer Dreams and fine Fancies: Indeed few ſpeak out ſo, but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny think thus in their minds, and therefore are for being ſure of
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:46484:171"/> ſomething, letting alone theſe glorious Imaginations for ſuch who believe them. It is ſaid, there is one Nerve more in the Eye of Man then in Brutes, by which he is enabled to lift it up. If this be not loſt for want of uſe, look upwards in a clear Night, ye earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly minded. Obſerve the Firmament beſpangled with Stars, and do ye not really gueſs there may be above them ſome greater Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency then Gold and Silver which Canker and Ruſt? <hi>Seek him that maketh the ſeven Stars and Orion,</hi> Amos 5. 8. <hi>whoſe is the World and the fulneſs thereof,</hi> Pſal. 50. 12. and you muſt conclude he hath greater things in his diſpoſal, then what we now ſee or handle. Be not ſo raſh and fooliſh to perſwade your ſelves there are no ſuch things, becauſe you do not believe them; for in your Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion it would be an odd kind of reaſoning, that there was no ſuch things as Riches, becauſe Beaſts know them not: And it is alike abſurdity to deny thoſe <hi>true Riches</hi> our Saviour ſpeaks of, <hi>Luke</hi> 16. 11. only for that covetous Worldings will not know nor believe them. If they will not, they ſhall loſe their part in them; and that will occaſion greater trouble, then now it is to miſs a good Bargain or Purchaſe. 'Tis perverſe Humour and Oppoſition to the Truth that any are unbelieving, for would they but impartially examine thoſe Evidences of Faith we have, they muſt fully aſſent: But this wicked and ſtubborn World is afraid the Goſpel ſhould be true, and therefore will not look upon its Pillars and Grounds of Truth, leaſt they ſhould be found too ſtrong, and then ſuch muſt not continue in Tranſgreſſion. They are willing to graſp and hold faſt what they have, and they take effectual Care not to attend to any thing, how true ſoever which may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade to the contrary. O profound Policy and Wiſdom! To refuſe to be Happy here and hereafter, becauſe by coveting after Riches they will pierce themſelves through with many Sorrows; and wilfully ſubject themſelves unto temporal and eternal Miſery, only to hug themſelves a little with ill gotten abundance. What unheard of Folly is this! There being ſet before the Sons of Men good and evil, they will loſe the one and incur the other, by conſidering of neither before-hand. Good God! That Men ſhould ſet at naught the moſt ineſtimable thing in the World, and yet blindly run upon accurſed Miſery. Reaſon it ſelf would tell them, that there is no harm to ſeek after the greateſt Good, and if it be grievous to think of the Evil, ſo they cannot endure that, how much more to ſuffer it? And they had better think thereof and ſo eſcape,
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:46484:171"/> then (as now they do) ſhut it out of their Minds, and thus una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidably run into it.</p>
               <p>This may be applied to all manner of unbelief, Ignorance and Sin, but Covetouſneſs hath a mixture of all, for otherwiſe a Man would not renounce his part in the <hi>Portion of</hi> Iſrael for thouſands of Gold and Silver. Were he perſwaded he hath a Soul, and of its due worth, he would not loſe it to gain the whole World, when now he doth to get a leſs part thereof, then the point of a Pin is to an Acre of Ground. Covetouſneſs doth ſtrangely fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten the affections to the Earth, and takes them quite off from Heaven: The mind is daubed over with thick Clay that it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives not Spiritually, and ſo intent upon things Temporal that he regards not the things Eternal. And thus comes in him <hi>an evil heart of unbelief in departing from the living God;</hi> Nevertheleſs let him ſtill know he is bound to obey the Commandments. If one hath never taken the Oath of Allegiance, yet he is obliged to keep the Kings Laws; if he doth not, he ſhall be puniſhed accordingly. So likewiſe, if one was never Baptized nor enters into Covenant with God, yet ſtill he lives under his Laws; <hi>Every tranſgreſſion and diſobedience received a juſt recompence of reward,</hi> Heb. 2. 2. He is Lord over all, the Great King of all the Earth, and requires ſubjection from every Creature; thoſe his Enemies which would not have him reign over them, he will ſend forth his Armies and deſtroy them. Who will not mind Scripture his revealed Law, are at this preſent tranſgreſſours againſt the ſame, and ſhall at the laſt day be condemned by it; <hi>For the iniquity of his Covetouſneſs was I wroth, and ſmote him: I hid me, and was wroth, and he went fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly in the way of his heart,</hi> Iſa. 57. 17.</p>

               <p>It is granted that all ſin hath ſome delight or conveniency, but then the pain and evil is much greater; and ſo it is here, for Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs doth outwardly make a ſhew of Happineſs and Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, but when a little laid open, there may be ſeen more miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and folly.</p>

                  <hi>The love of Money is the Root of all evil, which while ſome have coveted after, they have erred from the Faith, and pierced themſelves through with many Sorrows,</hi> 1 Tim. 6. 10.

Whatever delight ariſes from this ſin, is cheifly by admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtring proud and pleaſing thoughts, and the Torment which doth accompany it, is alſo by Vexation of Spirit.

It may be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all he is diſappointed of the expected lucre: When the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions are extreamly ſet upon a thing, there is proportionable grief to miſs of it; and it is a further aggravation, if it might have been had unleſs for ſuch a miſtake and fooliſhneſs. This often happens to every one that is greedy of gain, for he doth not catch all he hunts after, ſo he ſuffers Wearineſs in the purſuit, and more Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row in the loſs thereof. But when he doth obtain, doth not that make amends for other diſappointments? Indeed there is ſome comfort when things happen according to deſire, but then like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe is more trouble when they do not; one gainful deſign that is defeated, brings more Torment then twenty which ſucceed well. A little evil will counterpoiſe much good, for that makes a laſting and deep impreſſion of Sorrow, when this doth only cauſe light and ſudden degrees of Joy; Which proceeds from Mans corruption and puniſhment ſince the fall, and inſtructs him if he would learn ſo much, that <hi>his Happineſs is not of this
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:46484:174"/> World.</hi> It is ſo in them who have their affections moſt regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, but much more where thoſe are looſe, head-ſtrong and outragious.</p>
               <p>The covetous cannot obtain all he propoſes to himſelf; Many things are out of his power, and what are in, there are ſeveral ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents and hindrances which grieve him at the heart. Moreover, Fire, Theft, Deceit, Tricks and Law-Suits, and ſuch like things, do often rob and ſpoil of a conſiderable part he poſſeſſes. It is irkſome to reflect that what was gotten with ſo long pains and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, ſhould be thus taken away; If the murrain falls upon his Cattle, a blaſt or unſeaſonable Weather upon his Corn, he never thinks upon God ſo much as then, for his heart to fret and conceive horrid Imaginations which he is ready to out with (the Lord knows them all one as if he did) but refrains, for he would meet with the utmoſt deteſtation amongſt Men if he ſhould through his own covetous mind Blaſpheme the Holy one of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> If he doth not come up to this Abomination of Wickedneſs, yet who is beſotted to his abundance cannot endure any part thereof to be diminiſhed without impatiency and murmuring. He hath ſufficient left in anothers Opinion, but not in his own, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is enraged; O if it had not been for this pull back, how wealthy he had been; why you are ſo ſtill, ay, but he had been more wealthy, and there is the Vexation. When that is taken away which was glewed in, it is as if part of his heart was rent away therewith.</p>
               <p>It is a leading ſtep towards Happineſs for a Man to order aright his deſires; if theſe are fixt upon a ſure and laſting good that cannot be ſhaken, then he is happy; but if he will let them out only upon an appearance of good, which beſides is tottering and moveable, then his happineſs is ſuch alſo, a meer deluſion, uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and without. It may be compared to a Wave of the Sea driven with the Wind and toſſed. Sometimes it is near, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain afar of: <hi>Labour not to be rich, and ceaſe from thy own Wiſdom, VVilt thou ſet thine eyes upon that which is not? For riches certainly make themſelves VVings, they flee away as an Eagle towards Heaven,</hi> Prov. 23. 4, 5. They are from without, and who places his love upon them, it muſt be ſubject to the ſame inconſtancy. They being in a continual ebb, the Mans Soul moves with them, being now a little puft up and then is brought low. He is harraſſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:46484:174"/> joy and grief, the one lifts up the Waves when there is emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſs underneath; the other preſſes down with full and real cares, which being cloſe and compact ſit heavy and grievous upon him.</p>
               <p>Suppoſe a Man ſet on work to make an endleſs Chain which he begins link by link, ever and anon one which he hath already made is broken, which is vexatious to go back and mend. If he doth daily add more, and make it longer, yet he will never have done, for it is endleſs. He vainly pleaſes himſelf with the addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions he makes, but cannot come to true contentment; for he will never ſee an end of his labour, and at laſt if it ſhould reach from one corner of the Earth to the other, it would not fill his mind. In like manner, he that gathereth Riches doth often loſe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what he hath already gotten, this is diſquietude; If he doth dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly make his heap greater, he hugs himſelf with a ſlight fancy or Opinion, but when will his work be at an end? For there is more to be gotten ſtill. If he ſhould compaſs Sea and Land, get the whole World into his poſſeſſion, yet all would not ſatisfie his Soul. If raiſed up to its due pitch, all the Gold of <hi>Ophir</hi> cannot ſatisfie her exceeding deſires, which reach after greater things. Do ye think thoſe who have the Stars under their feet value theſe little things here below? The faithful Chriſtian whilſt in the body with his mind aſcends up, and thence caſts a contemptuous eye upon the little dazling things here, with which he thinks irkſome to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide. A Cheſt cannot be filled with Wiſdom, nor a Bag with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, no more can the Soul with the corruptible things of Gold and Silver.</p>
               <p>I may here appeal to the unbelieving earthly Man (who makes the worſt uſe of reaſon by employing it to ſo mean purpoſes as to <hi>lade himſelf with thick Clay.</hi> Is there need of much ſtudy and polite learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to fill a Dung-pot?) How much haſt thou got already? If a cart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>load of Coyn and many thouſand Acres of Land, yet doſt thou not covet more? <hi>Haſt thou not pulled down the Old, and built greater Barns?</hi> Haſt not thou forgotten thy former little requeſts, and is not thy appetite ſtretched out larger to receive yet more? The greater extent his Eſtate is of, the more parcels of ground lye adjoyning to them, which would be <hi>Commodious;</hi> and ſo he is led on with endleſs deſire. Well, reflect upon them altogether, and do they yield true and real contentment? Are thy deſires abated with daily Multiplying? It is ſtrange that a reaſonable Creature
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:46484:175"/> ſhould ſet his Love upon, and be hankering after that which doth not ſatisfie. When he hath long tryed and cannot ſtop the leaſt craving, yet ſtill to go on, making it the more importunate and urgent. If thouſands of Gold and Silver will not content a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Deſire, how can it be expected, that adding a few hundreds more ſhould preſently dam up the whole Current of them? If a Gallon of drink will not quench the Thirſt of a Dropſie, much leſs will a ſpoonful. There is a wrong Application and Remedy to cure the diſeaſe of the mind; for ſo it may be here called, in that it doth torment, and only through this miſtake bring evil upon Men. That conſtant and endleſs Thirſt after Happineſs, They do not take the right Courſe to allay, or to obtain what they ſo much long after. Some make uſe of one thing, ſome of another; but here the Man trys if he can do it with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtant and periſhing Riches, ſo unſutable; but further becauſe the thing to be redreſſed is within, and this is without. Was ever ſuch Sottiſhneſs, when one is ready to periſh with Hunger and Thirſt, only to give him Gold to ſmell unto? And there being as natural a Deſire in the Soul after Happineſs, as the Body after Food and Moiſture, how can Money truly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>It is not ſo much the glittering of Gold for that becomes <hi>Dim,</hi> nor the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

How much doſt thou propoſe to thy Self? Why, another hath the ſame already, and he is not ſatisfied; and why ſhouldſt thou in the ſame Condition? Thou haſt lower Thoughts, but they will Riſe with thy Wealth, and if thine ſhould come to be equal with his, thy Thoughts would be the ſame alſo. <hi>He that loveth Silver ſhall not be ſatisfied with Silver, nor he that loveth abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance with increaſe: This is alſo Vanity,</hi> Eccleſ. 5. 10.

If People would uſe only Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt and diligent Endeavours in their Calling, and expect Gods bleſſing, let him judge what is the Competency, and not we our ſelves. But if it is meaſured by the covetous Mans Opinion, when he ſhall ceaſe to ask any further, then is no hope to obtain it: For he may as well think when he goes as far as he can ſee, that he ſhall touch the Horizon, as that he ſhall be ſatisfied, when he gets what he now propoſes within himſelf?

                  <hi>Take heed and beware of Covetouſneſs, for a Mans life conſiſteth not in the abundance of things he poſſeſſeth,</hi> Luke 12. 15. 'Tis en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced with a double caution to prevent the leaſt beginning there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and an excellent Reaſon added. And though the Wiſdom of the World ſeems to confront this, for they would account none truly Wiſe, but who gets Riches, and ſo again whoſoever doth, he muſt be neceſſarily Wiſe; yet as ſure as God is, and we have any Revelation from him, there is another Notion of Wiſdom. Man was ſent into this World, and endued with underſtanding that he ſhould be Wiſe. He is not to continue here, but only paſs through and ſo away. Now that he ſhould do nothing but pick up Dirt in the Road, ſeems a moſt Senſeleſs thing: For though he was made of Earth, yet this here treated of is no part of his Nature: it neither came into the World with him, nor ſhall go out with him. Our days fly as a Poſt till the laſt cometh, and in that day all our Thoughts ſhall periſh, all the Labour we have taken under the Sun ſignifieth nothing. The end of that was to Miniſter things for Life, but when this is demanded, all thoſe things likewiſe vaniſh which did relate thereunto: there is no <note place="margin">Jer. 51. 13.</note> more riſing up early to eat the Bread of Carefulneſs, Bodily work ceaſeth, Worldly buſineſs is at end. It avails not to have been cumbred about many things, to have heaped up Riches and gotten Gain. A Man ſhall not by having ſo done redeem his Soul, nor give to God a Ranſom for it: But he is to be examined, whether he was more employed about the one thing needful, which ſhall not be taken away, and will ſtand in ſtead, when all theſe things ſhall fail. When a Man comes to die, if he had all Pleaſures, Riches and Honours, he is not therefore in a better Condition; much leſs is he who hath beſtowed all his time to be a little more Rich then his other Neighbours, and for this he hath for<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>eited his Right to the Heavenly inheritance, which otherwiſe he might have been Partaker of. He counted himſelf a cunning Fellow whilſt he lived, becauſe he knew how to get Money and keep it,
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:46484:178"/> thinking others Fools who had not ſuch a high value thereof as himſelf. And perhaps, thought them unwiſe who mind Religion, which was an hindrance to Gain, and alſo Chargeable, he did not ſee them get any thing by it: Whilſt he letting alone Words, did Compaſs real and ſubſtantial Coyn: For all he hugs himſelf ſo much in his own Wiſdom, he ſhall be the meereſt Fool. He is ſenſible what a Vexation it is to loſe a Pound to ſave a Penny (for this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly happens to covetous Niggards) and the torment will not be leſs when he ſhall come to know, that for a little earthly Pelf he is deprived of a Kingdom. The opinion of the World is, if they ſee one always diligent in buſineſs and he grows Rich, they conclude him to be a very Wiſe man; another doth not neglect his Calling, but Labours therein ſo far as to provide things neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary and convenient. But in the firſt place doth carefully obſerve his Duty towards God, and will ſometimes loſe a temporal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, rather then let ſlip an opportunity of doing his Soul good, him they term a fooliſh and ſimple Fellow. Whatever Men think now, at length it will be plainly diſcerned between him that ſerveth God, and who ſerveth him not, and which of the twain is moſt Wiſe. Even now we perceive the one hath hopes in his Death, the other goes away not knowing what ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of him. Men think it enough if they do but mind their buſineſs whilſt they live, beſides they underſtand not what they ſhould do; but what Wiſdom is it to be employed about that, which ſhortly ſhall ceaſe, ſeeming all one as if it had not been at all, and to leave that undone, for which they muſt eternally ſuffer? They have nothing to truſt unto but this Life, of which they are not aſſured for a Week nor a Day, before they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of the greateſt and Remedileſs Folly that ever was.</p>
               <p>For their Wit and Contrivance in getting Money: It is to be obſerved how corrupt Nature is carried violently to evil. It is eaſie to Swim with the Stream, ſo to find out thoſe crafty and hidden things of diſhoneſty. They are learnt from one to another, any one may know them, that will look into the Practiſe of the World. And the Devil will be ready to ſuggeſt more. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it ſignifies little if he is Wiſe in the way, if he is not ſo in the end. He who makes a Journey to ſuch a place to no purpoſe, if he doth go the right and neareſt way, is a Fool for all that. And if Covetouſneſs is not the principal buſineſs, and end of Mans Life, he can never Act prudently who Labours for it all his days,
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:46484:178"/> though with the utmoſt Skill and Dexterity. He that is very di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent in gathering Straws, and leaves none behind him, will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver paſs for a Wiſe man. Let the bundle be every day bigger, yet if never ſo great, it is all to a vain Purpoſe.</p>
               <p>The reſult of the whole is, that God hath provided for man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind <hi>Bags which wax not Old, a Treaſure in the Heavens that fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not,</hi> Luke 12. 33. unto which he now calls and invites them to accept of: in the mean while he Commands to abſtain from what is an hindrance to this, which alſo is hurtful and diſquieting. It is better truſting unto him, then ſeeking unto the Creature: His Goodneſs and Wiſdom are juſtified; yea, to be admired and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed withal. <hi>Let your Converſation be without Covetouſneſs, and be content with ſuch things as ye have: For he hath ſaid, I will never leave thee nor forſake thee,</hi> Heb. 13. 15.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Of Anger, Wrath, Hatred, Malice, Envy.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>BEfore hath been conſidered that inordinate Love and Deſire after Meat, Drink, Women and Money, the ſeveral Idols of this lower World, which draw after them ſuch a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of Followers by holding forth the outward ſhew of <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Happineſs.</hi> But upon the ſtrict and through inquiry every one muſt acknowledge, it is not in me. The Man is cheat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all the while; he may ſtumble over, among, and within them all, ſeeking Reſt and finding none. God is the chief and only Good, Who ever left him and proſpered? It is as impoſſible to be Happy without him, as that there ſhould be light of Noon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, when the Sun is under this part of the Earth.</p>
               <p>Nothing is more miſerable, and yet nothing more Proud then Man, was the obſervation of a very Heathen; but we know whence to derive this accurſed Nature. It came down from his Forefather, who would be <hi>as Gods knowing good and evil,</hi> Gen. 3. 5. the Author of his own Happineſs: We are his Children, and would be working it out of our ſelves. Let the only Wiſe God declare unto them, it is in the way of his Commandments, that he is the Lover of mankind and ordained ſuch for their Good, yet they will think otherwiſe, and ſo deſpiſe his Wiſdom and Truth. Which is ſuch an iniquity as themſelves ſhall find their own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of Happineſs to be Folly, falſhood and diſappointment; and ſhall be recompenced with <hi>abhorring and Confuſion of Face for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Iſa. 66. 24.</note> If that wherein they moſt truſt, deceive them; much more will thoſe things wherein they do not place ſo great Expectation. If the Principal faculties of Soul when they ſtand in oppoſition to God, will not afford true and real contentment; much leſs will the inferiour Paſſions, which disjointed from him do nothing
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:46484:179"/> but torment and make miſerable. When neither deſire nor love with their ſeveral Objects are able to make a wicked Man hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, much leſs will the other parts of his Soul which condemn and vex him; His underſtanding doth reprove his Ways, the other Paſſions do torture or Diſcompoſe. If it were not to keep him in life, he had rather have no Soul at all, but would become al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together fleſh and ſence, that he might have all things to reliſh, but nothing to embitter his delights. This wiſh is impoſſible, as it is mean and degenerous; for He who faſhioned every part of us both of Soul and body, hath likewiſe ſo ordained that if they be not brought into Obedience, Sanctified, and made Happy, then as they were the inſtruments of ſin, ſo of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, and to render Miſerable: Pain and Sickneſs to the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, or if that be not, Grief and Indignation to the Soul. As here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after there is no middle ſtate between Heaven and Hell, nor any ſtanding ſtill now between both, ſo it is of Happineſs and Miſery. If that which is given to promote the one is not made uſe of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, it will tend to the other: If the Soul is not brought into Obedience unto Happineſs, then it falls down into Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and Miſery. How we are to be regulated throughout hath been ſhewed Chap. 2. Where the whole Man was taken in pieces that he might be ſet in a right frame; The Underſtanding, Will, and Affections were ſurveyed. In the two firſt, both the good and evil were diſcovered; the affections were treated of as tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to good, if Governed by the Law of God. Now it remains according to the propoſed method to ſpeak of that evil and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry they occaſion by being ruled according to the Law of the Fleſh. The corruption and abuſe of Love as to its ſeveral Objects hath been handled in the laſt foregoing Chapters; When the good and evil of a thing is laid open, the one may be choſen, and the other avoided. And hereby it may be a little more particularly manifeſted unto Men (would God it were done by a better inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but here it is endeavoured according to the ability himſelf hath been pleaſed to give.) <hi>Thou art good, and doſt good, teach me thy Statutes. Righteous art thou O Lord, and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pright are thy Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. The Teſtimonies that thou haſt commanded, are exceeding Righteous, and very Faithful,</hi> Pſal. 119. 68, 137, 138. Though he hath the greateſt Sovereignty over Creatures, and he might (as ſome earthly Potentates do by their Vaſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="342" facs="tcp:46484:180"/> which would not be for their good, but only expoſe them to hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and inconvenience. But God is not as the Son of Man (who is Ignorant, Proud and Cruel) for there is an intrinſick worth and excellency, a real goodneſs in the very nature of all things our gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Lord requires; as on the other hand there is Baſeneſs, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity and Evil in forbidden things. <hi>Seek Good and not Evil, that ye may live; Hate the Evil, and love the Good,</hi> Amos 5. 14, 15. <hi>Beloved follow not that which is Evil, but that which is Good,</hi> 3 Joh. 11. This is the Law and the Prophets, It is the ſum of all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of God.</p>
               <p>We are required to <hi>put off Anger, Wrath, Malice,</hi> Col. 3. 8. <hi>Hatred, Variance, Envyings,</hi> Gal. 5. 20, 21, 26. So certainly there is Evil in them, and they hinder our Happineſs. All anger is not ſinful nor forbidden, but when without cauſe and immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate; Either without Provocation, or upon little and trivial things. Such a temper is contrary to the Peace and Tranquility of Mind: When the Winds blow, and Storms ariſe, there ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds a troubled Sea, the Waves roaring: Not much unlike is the Soul of Man, when Contempt, Affront, or other cauſe hath moved him, that which before was Calm and Smooth, begins to Riſe and Swell, and violently beats upon the Banks. The fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the inward Man may be diſcerned, when the Eyes ſhall roul up and down like ſparks of Fire among the Stubble, <hi>the form of his Viſage changed,</hi> Multitude of Words do preſs at the door of <note place="margin">Dan. 3. 19.</note> the Mouth, that none are able to get forth but ſtammering and confuſed noiſe; The Hands are with difficulty kept from doing miſchief, the Teeth grind and chatter, Reaſon is baniſhed, and nothing but Rage to be ſeen; all theſe outward ſigns do diſcover that ſtrange agitation and reſtleſsneſs the Soul is in. This is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly Wrath, the higheſt degree of Anger. Man is deſpicable to look upon abſtractedly, but when thus ſtirred, one would admire ſo little a Creature ſhould do ſo great things. His Soul is never ſo much diſcerned to be confined and pent up in a narrow Room as then; it would break through the Walls, and cauſes thoſe about him to fear. Then is raiſed a ferment and heat of the Blood, which is no more true courage (though it hath a ſhew thereof) then deſperate acts and ravings of diſtracted Perſons; Neither is it Wiſdom. <hi>The Fool rageth and is confident. He that is ſoon angry, dealeth fooliſhly,</hi> Prov. 14. 16, 17. <hi>The diſcretion of a Man defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Anger, and it is his Glory to paſs over a Tranſgreſſion,</hi> Prov. 19.
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:46484:180"/> 11. Who knows the utmoſt that is in an injury, is leaſt moved with it; and alſo this is a ſign of a truly great and exalted Spirit, for Reeds and not Oaks are ſhaken with the Wind. A little and empty Soul is toſſed to and fro with every breath of provoking Language. He ſerves like the fightings of Wild Beaſts to divert Spectators, only ſuch an one is worſe and more deſtitute of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, for they bite others, but <hi>he teareth himſelf in his Anger,</hi> Job. 18. 4. The whole Man is hurry and diviſion from himſelf, for the time he knows not what he doth; That inward Vexation and Perplexity, that Impatiency and deſire of Revenge, thoſe Malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Wiſhes of Hurt, if they ſhould not come forth into Act, do certainly hurt himſelf.</p>
               <p>But commonly it proves Miſchievous to others, both to Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes and ſingle Perſons.

Ambition and Revenge are the great Incendiaries, which ſprang from him who would be like the Moſt High and thence fell from Heaven. And therefore now continues his hatred againſt God by with-drawing as many as he can from his Obedience; and alſo his own envy at the Happineſs to which Men are appointed, which he hinders as much as he can. It is his employment to nouriſh and inſtil in the hearts of Men all things that may do hurt, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt which Rage is one Principal Inſtrument for carrying on his Peſtilent deſign. It works Tranſgreſſion againſt God, and Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief to Men, both the Actors and Sufferers: It goes forth by Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, or two by two.

This is piſhed off and ſlighted with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out duly conſidering the reaſon of the Command. It is matter of the greateſt aſtoniſhment, that ſo little and contemptible a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as the Son of Man is, ſhould behave himſelf ſtoutly and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainfully againſt the Lord his God; that he who in himſelf is very fearful and trembles at every thing, ſhould dare to provoke his Maker. The reaſon of ſuch abominable preſumption is, That God having here ordained a life of Tryal and Obedience of Faith, The place of his Eſpecial reſidence is in Heaven which is afar of: And he remains inviſible, undiſcovered to the blinded world. So they either not know, or not think of him, and therefore uſe ſo much boldneſs and contempt towards him. But ſhould he be pleaſed to manifeſt himſelf a little more, had they but the leaſt beholding of his Majeſty and Greatneſs, theſe ſame perſons would creep, who now lift up themſelves againſt the <hi>Holy One of</hi> Iſrael. No Queſtion, there were ſome of as daring Spirits (as any now among us) who ſtood by Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> when God deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed there, and we know what effect it had upon them; The like is not to be expected again in this World, but yet they ſhall be ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned to meet with that God againſt whom they have been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient, and ſhall have a more ſenſible and laſting apprehenſion then the <hi>Iſraelites had,</hi> for their Souls will be terrour round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout.

               <p>The leaſt tendencies towards this ſin are to be avoided, as may be ſeen by the ſtrict manner of thoſe Precepts, <hi>Mat. 6. 14, 15. Mat.</hi> 18. 21, 35. Which indiſpenſably enjoyn the duty of actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al forgiveneſs of injuries as is poſſible for Words to expreſs. If you have a mind to be revenged, why ſhould not God take re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge on you for the affronts you have offered unto him? He will certainly deal ſo with you, as you do with others, and then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge your ſelves if ye dare. He will be more too hard for you, then you can be with one another: You had better be ſtill, for he is ready to execute upon you according as you ſmite your fellow Servants. Have they injured you?

It is for our preſent good to compoſe diſturbed thoughts, to allay the ſwelling of mind; The God whom we ſerve is a ſufficient comfort under all reproaches, we may appeal unto him, Be thou my judge, for I have walked innocently: Though they curſe, yet bleſs thou. <hi>Follow Peace with all Men, and Holineſs, without which no Man ſhall ſee the Lord.

               <p>It is to be admired that the Devil ſhould make uſe of and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with a Temptation, as is wholly made up of Torment. He who knows that natural temper in all (and accordingly prepares his others baits) of being willing to be happy and averſe from Miſery, yet through his ſubtlety hath made ſo unpleaſant a thing be received by them. Theſe are ſome of <hi>the depths of Satan,</hi> Rev. 2. 24. But if we found this, it is bottomed on Pride, for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſuggeſted to the hearts of Men; Nothing doth ſo much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to their Happineſs as to ſeem great and be highly eſteemed, to be ſet above that none ſhould dare to offend them; to maintain this Principle he makes them ſubmit to much uneaſineſs and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as is done by ſwallowing down thoſe black ſins, Anger, Wrath, Malice, Revenge, in order to gratifie a proud Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour.</p>

Neither Meat and Drink will nouriſh what this pines and conſumes away: for wild Beaſts to devour alive is more tolerable, for they make a quick diſpatch, but this is as little Vermine continually feeding on the Liver. He breaths forth ſighing and grief, within is anguiſh, a little further is fretting, without is evil ſpeaking and injurious action; It rejoyceth in evil, and is ſad at the good which cometh to another; It will miſconſtrue every thing that is capable to be ſo. It is ſullen, and will not ſpeak out of others well doing, which they cannot gain-ſay, and ſhould glorifie God for the gifts he giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth unto Men. What is the occaſion of all this evil and miſery? Not pleaſing the fleſh, only anothers Happineſs; Becauſe ſuch an one is contented and hath good things, he is murmuring under vexatious Thoughts, <hi>As he ſees it, he is grieved, he ſhall gnaſh with his Teeth and melt away,</hi> Pſal. 112. 10.</p>

The firſt is Ignorance and ſtrange iniquity; the ſecond upon Inquiry will be found un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable and without cauſe. Do you hate them for following that which is good? You will not acknowledge ſo, for an evil Work you pretend: Why, look throughly, and you will ſee no ſuch thing. Examine impartially both ſides, and it will appear good; but then ariſes Envy and Hatred, that ſuch ſhould be better then your ſelves. Then in your Opinion they do good, Why will you not alſo do the ſame? In a temporal Matter none Envies ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for a thing which himſelf may have, or the other would willingly help him unto. This turns into Thanks and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will. And why ſhould it not be the ſame in reference to the things of God? Is another righteous, and doſt thou ſecretly imagine him Happy therein? Thou mayſt be ſo likewiſe, if thou wouldeſt
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:46484:184"/> do the ſame things. <hi>God is no reſpecter of Perſons,</hi> and he will give his Grace to thee, if thou wilt ſeek after it as he hath done. <hi>In my Fathers houſe are many Manſions,</hi> ſaid the Son of God, who came down from Heaven. Anothers ſtriving will not prejudice thee; if only ſome few might come there, we might well be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry at thoſe who would get before us: But ſeeing <hi>God would have all to be ſaved, and Chriſt taſted Death for every Man,</hi> there is no fear but thou mayſt be Partaker alſo, if another doth endeavour after the ſame Grace and Glory. He will do his endeavour that thou mayſt come alſo, but this thou doſt not like, Why ſhould he be a Buſie-body in another Mans Matter? But conſider a little, if a Man had incurred the Diſpleaſure of the King, and ſo was liable to Impriſonment and Death; a Friend would put him in the way to preſerve and reſtore him into Favour, is not this eſteemed a kindneſs? A wicked Life and Converſation renders liable to the Wrath of God and Damnation of Hell, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is not to blamed, who would perſwade to repent and eſcape it. When one is <hi>ready to periſh,</hi> What fault is it for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to put him in mind to return to his Fathers houſe, who will receive with all Loving kindneſs, that hence forward he may live in obedience and favour of ſo good a God, die with Comfort, and enjoy him in Glory. What harm is in all this? <hi>Shall evil be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenced for Good? For they have digged a Pit for my Soul; remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that I ſtood before thee, to ſpeak good for them, and to turn away thy Wrath from them,</hi> Jer. 18. 20.</p>
               <p>Ay, but ſuch an one believes we ſhall be damned and miſerable, he thinks ſo of us, as if he would have it; ſurely he is to be juſtly hated for this.</p>
               <p>This ſeems to be the very Reaſon why the wicked have been ſo deſpiteful againſt the Godly in all Ages.

But if one was throughly bent to commit Theft, Robbery, Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and thereupon think himſelf ſafe, becauſe he would not know the Kings Laws, ſhould we think him ſo? He would be hanged for all that. In like manner God hath publiſhed his Word to the World, and whether Men will take notice of the Truths of it or no, they only lie dormant for a while, but he will judge and condemn by it; and their ignorance will not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe, but aggravate their Guilt, becauſe it was malicious and wilful.

               <argument>
                  <p>OF FEAR.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>FOraſmuch as Fear is implanted in all Men, and hath relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to ſomewhat, the ſubject of this enſuing Diſcourſe will be, Whether it is better to ſtifle, diſregard, or to provide againſt that Fear? Not to Fear at all is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, ſo not deſirable by a prudent Man, for it ſerves to divers good Ends and purpoſes; but <hi>not to be afraid with any Amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> 1 Pet. 3. 6. Not to be ſo horribly afflicted with it as ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally People are, is a thing which may be attained; And if Religion ſheweth us the only good and wiſe way, which is more ſafe then any other, herein it tends very much to the Happineſs of Mankind. We are all poor imperfect Creatures, Men and not Gods; yet of ſuch a ſtrange aſpiring Temper, that we are apt to forget what we are: So it is neceſſary as to us all for the <hi>Lord to put us in fear that we may know our ſelves to be but Men,</hi> Pſal. 9. 20. When we are lifted up, this depreſſeth us low again; we are ſwoln with Pride, but contracted with Fear. That is Big and Stately, this ſhrinks into its due Poſture; That ſtruts and thinks it ſhall never be moved, this reminds of the Truth that he is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to injury and falling. What a Monſtrous thing would Man be, if there was nothing to allay the proud Humour? Whither would he be carried, when every little thing doth puff him up as it doth a Bubble, if there was not to pull down? A ſmall conceit of Happineſs tranſports him beyond himſelf, ſo it is requiſite a ſence of that Miſery within him, and he is further liable unto, ſhould humble and reduce him into right Frame. That he ſhould not be always cheated and exalted with a Lye, but be truly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:46484:190"/> of his own State and Condition. Let him not imagine he is come only to Swagger here, or think himſelf the chiefeſt in the Creation; <hi>Our Lips are our own, who is Lord over us?</hi> Pſal. 12. 4. For aſſuredly there is One greater then he: Who made him, and gave himſelf power thus to Domineer, muſt be more great: And it is he who is infinitely above us, and him we ought to Fear. As he made, ſo he can daſh in pieces. He hath faſhioned us ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to Frailty and Conſumption within, to Hurt and Caſualty without. He doth good, ſo likewiſe he can Puniſh: <hi>He is the great Law-giver who is able to ſave and deſtroy.</hi> Indeed the ſence thereof is the cauſe of all the Fear in the World, tho Men would fain ſtifle the Apprehenſion of God, which he hath ordered to be conveyed unto them by their own Fears; yet they will not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge him, whom they do Fear. What malicious ſtubbornneſs is this? What abſurd folly? Beſides natural awe and reverence, <note place="margin">Rom. 1.</note> they do dread him by reaſon of Tranſgreſſion, and they will ſin yet more by not owning him. They will not ſpeak out what they can hardly conceal; They would ſhut him out of their mind who is in every part, and viſible in all the World beſides. All the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of the Soul do diſcover him, the inclination of the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding to know him, the deſire and will to enjoy him, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry affection doth ſomewhat manifeſt him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Lord Reigneth, let the People tremble,</hi> Pſal. 99. 1. Some fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhly diſdaining to be kept under (who ignorantly would have been freed from what is their greateſt honour and good) have hence attempted at the very foundation; but by ſo doing they only <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>urt themſelves, and provoke him yet more. God is above, and hath power over Men; they can neither make him nor themſelves ceaſe to be, or preſerve themſelves from his Dominion. Neither let the Worldly Wiſe Men think themſelves ſecure, becauſe they will drive the Sence and Fear of God out from within them. But he remembers their deſpiſing and negligence of him: They do only for a little time put off their Fears and Doubts, which will return ſadly upon themſelves when paſt remedy. <hi>I alſo will chooſe their deluſions, and will bring their Fears upon them, becauſe when I called none did Anſwer, when. I Spake they did not Hear,</hi> Iſa. 66. 4. In this ſhort and vain life, Men may caſt out of their hearts the Fear of God, and harden themſelves againſt him; but from the day of their Death, they will be forced to Fear him, when Fear will do no good. Their Soul will leap out nothing but fright and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſternation,
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:46484:190"/> and their Tormenting Paſſions will be ſtretched out to the utmoſt. In temporal evils the fear is often greater, but it is contrary as to Eternal. <hi>Who knoweth the Power of thine Anger? Even according to thy Fear, ſo is thy Wrath,</hi> Pſal. 90. 11.</p>
               <p>And however ſome will not Fear the greater, yet they do the leſs. If they do not chooſe the Fear of the Lord, they are afraid of every thing beſides which hath the leaſt Power to do hurt; let them pretend what they will, they do ſecretly, but unwillingly dread him: And this is the reaſon of that univerſal practice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Men of this World, to hear or think as little of him as may be, for they are uneaſie and diſturbed every time they hear him named, unleſs by way of cuſtomary Oath and Provocation. Which is one reaſon that makes the ſin of raſh Swearing and taking Gods Name in Vain ſo much in uſe upon frivolous Matters and Idle Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, for hereby it is made ſo familiar and common as takes off from that inward trembling they have at the leaſt ſerious thoughts of him. This is directly contrary to the third Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, which ſeems to have been therefore given, that <hi>this Glorious and Fearful Name, THE LORD THY GOD,</hi> Deut. 28. 58. ſhould not be made vile and cheap, for that would deſtroy the reverence we owe unto him; But this is a ſilly device of the wicked, for thus they ſin yet more, and by only ſtifling the ſence they do not take away, but increaſe the cauſe of their Fear; So it is likewiſe of their talking of Religion in their Drunken Fits, which is laughed at for a merry Faſhion, but is Abominable and Provoking, and is becauſe they cannot bear the ſober thoughts thereof. If one was to unravel the whole <hi>Myſtery of Iniquity,</hi> how much folly and contradiction would he find therein? But for all Mens doing they will never be too ſtrong for <hi>the Almighty,</hi> nor <note place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 22.</note> too cunning for the <hi>All-wiſe God.</hi> How much better had they ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit and confeſs unto God, <hi>Thou, even thou art to be feared,</hi> Pſal. 76. 7. <hi>Sanctifie the Lord of Hoſts himſelf, and let him be your Fear, and let him be your Dread, and he ſhall be for a Sanctuary,</hi> Iſa. 8. 13, 14. They muſt neceſſarily, and alſo do Fear ſomewhat, and on whom ſhould it be placed, but who is moſt worthy thereof? <hi>With God is terrible Majeſty, touching the Almighty we cannot find him out, he is excellent in Power and in Judgment, and in Ple<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="364" facs="tcp:46484:191"/> it is no diſparagement for the ſtouteſt heart to run from that, yea, he doth. And if ſome out of damned Pride may pretend to ſlight this, thinking it cowardly to fear inviſible powers; yet the time of Trial will come upon themſelves. <hi>And he that is couragious among the Mighty, ſhall flee away naked in that day, ſaith the Lord<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> Amos 2. 16. Zeph. 1. 14. His Power and Indignation will command Fear from the greateſt of his Enemies; ſo his Majeſty and Goodneſs do require <hi>Reverence and Godly Fear</hi> from all his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants. <hi>Who would not fear thee, O King of Nations? For to thee doth it appertain: Foraſmuch as among all the Wiſe Men of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and in all their Kingdoms there is none like unto thee,</hi> Jer. 10. 7.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Wherefore doth the wicked contemn God? He hath ſaid in his heart, Thou wilt not require it,</hi> Pſal. 10. 13. Another reaſon is before aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned, verſ. 4, 5. <hi>God is not in all his thoughts, thy judgments are far above out of his ſight.</hi> They pretend to deſpiſe whom either they not think of, or not know; or not believe; for if they did, it is impoſſible to diſregard him. A blind Man may run to the ſide of a ſteep Rock, or brink of a River, and yet not be concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at it, for he ſeeth not where he is: And when <hi>the fool ſaith in his heart there is no God,</hi> nor will admit the leaſt ſerious thoughts of him, then he may ſay within himſelf, <hi>Tuſh, God I care not for thee.</hi> He may bid defiance when he perceives no danger; Things at a diſtance are not feared, and ſome are apt to conclude, God is in Heaven, that he doth not mind what is ſaid or done here, that he is ſlow to take Vengeance, and will be pacified again. Such are the real Cauſes why Men are ſo bold to Tranſgreſs againſt him; <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſentence againſt an evil work is not Executed ſpeedily, therefore the hearts of the Sons of Men are fully ſet in them to do evil,</hi> Eccleſ. 8. 11. They have naturally an awful apprehenſion of God, and at firſt are fearful to offend him; but when they ſee others provoke him and no harm happen unto them, yea, ſometimes Proſper, they take Heart by little and little to ſin againſt him, eſpecially if they find no hurt upon themſelves. The ſenſual blinded World judge <note place="margin">Ezek. 12. 22, 23, 24.</note> very much by Events; and becauſe they ſee no ſuch dreadful Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments poured down upon Sinners, that all things happen alike to all, and continue as they were from the beginning of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Men may do as they will: it is the Preachers trade to cry out againſt Sin, but they are vain Words, for they come to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: Whereas they ſpeak of future Rewards and Puniſhments,
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:46484:191"/> and the time of Deciſion is not yet come. In this may be ſeen a Wiſe ordering of Divine Providence, that a Life of tryal might be had, that we might walk by Faith, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

However, they carry themſelves towards God, it is neither Courage nor Boldneſs; but proceeds from the Principles of a corrupt, baſe and timorous Nature, as will be more manifeſted an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>This is acknowledged, our excellent Religion doth not abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely take it away, but the Preſſures and Vexation thereof. It is neceſſary to prevent the Evils to come, and therefore to be retained; but a truly Religious Fear is not ſlaviſh, <hi>nor hath tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> By Fear of God we acknowledge our Subjection unto him; and this being mixed with Love makes <hi>Reverence,</hi> which the Soul is pleaſed ſhould have a conſtant abode over her. This makes the Man to <hi>walk humbly with his God,</hi> and not dejectedly. Every one doth ſtartle or ſhrink a little; <hi>but to have a trembling Heart, and to Fear day and night,</hi> Deut. 28. 65, 66. to be for the moſt part tormented with it, is the Curſe of the wicked, and not the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Mans Portion. He fears nothing, but what is natural or reaſonable to Fear. Indeed Gods own People have committed ſingle Acts of Sin, beſides infirmity, which he is pleaſed to <hi>cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſe in them, that they ſhould not be condemned with the Worid,</hi> 1 Cor. 11. 32. So they may be ſometimes in great Fear, as there are Examples in <hi>Job, David</hi> and other Saints. We are not to judge by what happens at ſome particular time, but the general Courſe of Life: And even this doth ſhew that Fear is the conſtant fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lower of Sin and Guilt; take away this, and the other will ceaſe. All Fear is becauſe of ſome evil which may happen: Now if it were not for what Scripture makes known, no other evil would come upon Sinners, but preſent and temporal inconveniencies, which they now ſee, But they do not Fear theſe at all: They know and can bear with Worldly evils; but further there is a Senſe that they have not done what they ſhould, that they have offended one Higher whom they were bound to obey, he is ready to inflict a Puniſhment, which they are conſcious that themſelves do deſerve, this makes them afraid. This is matter of Fact as
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:46484:192"/> every ones Conſcience can bear Witneſs to it; for thoſe ſecret and unknown Sins to the World, there is a dread of unſeen things. The Care to ſti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               <p>Even thoſe who do not ſeriouſly addict themſelves to the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and Knowledge of God, herein are found fearful: They cry Religion will make fearful, and themſelves are ſo, becauſe they have not to do with it as much as they ſhould: They are afraid to embrace it wholly through wrong apprehenſions and prejudices the Devil hath put into their Head, and yet they are afraid to let it alone. They falſly think that will diſquiet them, and they are certainly diſquieted if they neglect it. They are in a Strait, which puts them upon the outward Profeſſion, to ſatisfie their Fears and Doubts in this matter. The World runs upon miſtakes; for that Religion is their Duty, they are rightly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed by Fear, which is <hi>the beginning of Wiſdom;</hi> but that this which is the only Remedy, ſhould bring them into the <hi>Bondage</hi> thereof, they are falſly informed by him, who was a Lyar from the beginning. His ſubtilty lies in this; for he ſuggeſts, that if a little ſmattering of Religion is irkſome and will make fearful, much more will a great deal thereof; and therefore it is better to have but little to do with it, to prevent further uneaſineſs. Whereas indeed a through Compliance doth bring ſweetneſs and aſſurance: And to them only it is dreadful who do enter, or go but half way. What they do therein, may pacifie natural Conſcience; they may be ſoothed up with vain Hopes or Deceits, but they have no delight in God and his Ordinances: They dare not throughly examine their ſpiritual Condition, for then they would grow fearful, and hence look upon much Religion as a terrible affrightning thing. So their buſineſs is to do juſt enough as they think will ſave the Soul, but are careleſs and negligent as to more.

               <p>Sin and Religion are contrary one to another, as a Rebel is to his rightful Lord; the one would have the Laws of God obſerved, the other trangreſſes againſt them: So upon firſt ſight it may be diſcerned, which is moſt likely to get the Favour or avoid the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure of the Mighty God, who made and is above us all.

He is true, as certain as he is God, ſo that he will accompliſh what he hath ſpoken. And then the wicked and ungodly expoſe themſelves to a real Danger from his Wrath and Indignation. The fancied ſecurity they have againſt this is to forget God; they conclude that as long as they do not think of him, it is well enough. Something may be done according to the Cuſtom of the World, and ſo far they go to Church, and do ſome Religious Duties. But after that they will have no more to do with God, he muſt not be in their Feaſts,
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:46484:194"/> Worldly buſineſs, nor Company, they neither think nor ſpeak of him, but he is out of mind. This Principle conſiſts of Stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bornneſs and Contempt; for they are not only reſolved wilfully to break his Laws, but alſo make him as it were an underling, as not to ſuffer the Senſe of him to be in their Heart and Mouth, but when pleaſe them; which is to thruſt off his Authority and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, for <hi>that is over the Hearts of Men:</hi> from this manner of evil doing, there comes to be in them a ſlaviſh Fear and Dread, that they cannot endure the alone imagination, or to hear any thing of God, by way of Truth and Seriouſneſs. How uneaſie and diſturbed are they to hear him declared faithfully in his Word? Horror and Doubt do poſſeſs them inſtantly. Who object to Chriſtians as Guilty of Cowardice in fearing that, themſelves are affrightened at the very Thought and Rumour of the ſame thing. <hi>It ſhall be a Vexation only to underſtand the Report,</hi> Iſa. 28. 19. They are more afraid of hearing only the Words of God prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched or ſpoken of, then others are at what is ſignified by them. Now who have moſt of tormenting Fear, They who cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure to hear God named in Praiſe and Inſtruction, or who can ſpeak of him with Gladneſs and Comfort? They who tremble to go into the Sanctuary, or thoſe who can boldly and reverently approach to the Throne of Grace? They who cannot <hi>bear ſound Doctrine,</hi> or thoſe who contentedly <hi>hear the whole Will of God.</hi> They are afraid to hear God ſpeak unto them by Earthen Veſſels, Men of the ſame Paſſions and Fellow-Creatures; but how aſtoniſht and caſt down would they have been to have heard him from <hi>Mount Sinah,</hi> and will be when they come to die, and after that to Judgment. The boldeſt Workers of iniquity dare not go to hear thoſe who expound and apply the Word in Truth, but if to any they had rather ſit under thoſe deceitful handlers; who moſt of all betray a Cauſe, and hence others take Courage in their evil ways.</p>
               <p>Even in the wicked there is an acknowledgment and perſwaſion that God is to be Feared, and they could with they did likewiſe. But here obſerve the ſtrangeneſs of the Devils Work, how ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle his devices are, he drives them off through their own Fear; there is a little harſhneſs in R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="374" facs="tcp:46484:196"/> it is both natural and reaſonable to conſider that they may make ſure of it, and to be told of the Wrath to come that they may flee from it; for it were ſomething if they could turn away the evil by not thinking thereon; but <hi>the Gulph is fixed, the fire is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared,</hi> and they cannot be removed or quenched only by the care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſsneſs of thoſe who go the ready way to plunge themſelves in.

Am I terrified with the uneaſineſs of Religion, and ſhall I to avoid that for a little time bring upon my ſelf Eternal An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh of Mind? Are the ſtrivings of Gods Spirit irkſome now for a Seaſon? They are only ſo becauſe you will not comply with them, yet will you by reſiſting them draw on the Spirits of Darkneſs to Torment for evermore? If that be ſo grievous which is now for a ſhort time, it will be much more ſo that ſhall laſt to all Eternity; and therefore the leſs is to be ſubmitted unto to avoid the greater.

That is afraid to ſhed a few Penitential Tears, to avoid Weeping and Gnaſhing of Teeth; To ſtand in awe of a little thing, and run into a greater, is as if we ſhould run from the ſhaking of a leaf into a place of Dragons and Scorpions. Men conceive more hardſhip in the ways of Godlineſs then really there is; Strangers are affrightened at that which the acquainted find to be Pleaſantneſs and Peace. All the uneaſineſs in Religion is at firſt, or to thoſe who will not conform wholly to it, which true Courage and Reſolution might go throughly with, and then that would wear off. The Grace of God doth very much aſſiſt thoſe, who ſeek and work together with it.</p>
               <p>The two Principal hindrances are Fear and Enjoyment of Luſt; they may be comprehended under one, for there is a Fear of Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in miſſing it, but the frightning of trouble of Mind, and a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle heavineſs hinders from coming to Repentance. That which was implanted in Man to bring him unto God, is ſo tranſverſed as to keep him off; ſuch is only a fooliſh and more exceeding Fear:

They grow up they know not how, neither do they mind it: and then they look only to the preſent time, and what is juſt before them. By ſuch kind of ways they come to be Deſpiſers and umindful, but that it is not through want of Fear may be further illuſtrated by their fear in reference to other things.</p>
               <p>That keeps them in ungodlineſs and tranſgreſſion, ſo it hath a main influence on the common actions of Life. This being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to their Proud Nature, they endeavou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Indeed thoſe leſſer and ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry evils of life being ſo common, it doth not put them into trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling and amazement, but they are concerned ſo far as to avoid them. When they fly from the leaſt evil and the ſhadow there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, who cannot endure the leaſt Pain, Grief, or Diſcontent, and can only ſubject themſelves to dangers becauſe they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known and future; this argues a timorous diſpoſition.

So Fears do go round, and tho' they do not fix on the right Object, yet on every thing beſides that hath the leaſt power to do hurt, and all is by reaſon of that. They fear the Work of his hands, but do not fear the Maker of them all. And the only Reaſon of that is, becauſe they neither know nor ſee him, and he keeps ſilence: for would not theſe very <note place="margin">Iſa. 57. 11.</note> Men who adore viſible Greatneſs and tremble at every thing, do the like alſo if they perceived the leaſt Glimpſe of Gods Glory, or had the leaſt Manifeſtation of his dreadful Majeſty.

               <p>We have looked upon the Fears of Men in the midſt of life; <note place="margin">Of the Fear of Death.</note> We have ſeen how they behave themſelves when they are luſty and ſtrong; We have heard their diſdainful Talk and proud Boa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting, which in ſome meaſure hath been detected of Hypocriſie and Falſhood. What are their Thoughts and Proviſion againſt Death, either when it is afar off or it approacheth nigh? Now it is certain we do not (nor before) enter upon meer Words, but reality; for all the living know they muſt die, and every one is ſenſibly frightened with the apprehenſion thereof. <hi>Bildad</hi> ſtiles it the <hi>King of Terrors,</hi> Job 18. 14. As ſuch it poſſeſſes the minds of all Men at firſt, this is not denyed: And the other alſo would be no controverſie, unleſs contrary practiſe did make it doubtful, Whether Wickedneſs or Obedience is the beſt preſervation againſt the Fear and Danger of Death. If it be made evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent for the latter, the ſame concluſion again follows that
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:46484:198"/> Religion tends neceſſarily to the Happineſs and Safety of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</p>
               <p>In Truth, this point is moſt worthy of Obſervation and inſiſting upon; for though we are ſo much taken up with preſent things, we ſnatch at all Eaſe and Pleaſure, and decline every little pain or Vexation; yet Worldly Happineſs or Miſery is not much to be valued, ſeeing the beſt which happens here will never make one truly Happy, nor the worſt Miſerable: It ſo ſoon paſſeth away whatever delights or diſquiets. Nothing is ſo good here as to be truly deſirable, Nothing ſo bad but what can be endured: There is little difference whether we have a Calm and Smooth Voyage, or are toſſed to and fro with Tempeſts; but the only thing to be minded and care taken for, is, where we ſet a ſhore on the land of Eternity, <hi>for here we have no continuing City,</hi> Heb. 13. 14.

Wiſe and Fooliſh comprehend all Mankind, ſo they may be diſtinguiſhed and known by this one thing, for nothing is ſo worthy of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern and regard of a wiſe Man as death is. It is prudence to keep off and provide againſt all evils, and if the World calls thoſe wiſe who are ſo buſied about Toyes and Trifles, about the attainment of every little good and avoiding of every little evil, much more is he who doth the ſame as to the greater. If every one is diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly employed how it fares with him now, ſo doth an underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Man look about what ſhall become of him after this vain, ſhort and uncertain life is ended.</p>
               <p>In this great matter there are two deſigns in the World: the one is to drive out the thoughts of Death as much as they can, to be unmindful of their dying day that it is grown into a Proverb, till it is upon them, and ſo they go away when their time comes. The ſecond is of them who both pray, and alſo put in practiſe <hi>So teach us to number our Days that we may apply our hearts to Wiſdom,</hi> Pſal. 90. 12. Which of the twain is moſt wiſe and happy in their way, may be a little cleared.</p>
               <p>The reaſon of the firſt manner of doing is becauſe the thoughts of Death are Melancholy and Uncomfortable, ſo they think they do well to be rid thereof. Amidſt their jovialties ſometimes a word

But this is not all, The bare lying in the Grave is the leaſt of the fear of Sinners.

Theſe things and more of the like ſad Nature, the conſidering Sinner finds to be true, both in the Courſe of his Life, and more eſpecially towards the Cloſe thereof; he fears Death with another kind of dread then what is natural, or other Creatures of the ſamelikeneſs, (but not of the ſame wickedneſs) do.</p>

How comes it to paſs that the Wiſeſt, yea, and thoſe who ſet themſelves not to believe theſe things are ſtill terrified by them?

               <p>But inſtead thereof Men betake themſelves to the old general Policy of not thinking before-hand. What Senſeleſsneſs is this?

It is only ſo to evil Men, which any one may refrain to be. Is Death evil? Why it will remain ſo if you do not think of it; and if it be ſo ſad, that you cannot think thereof, to endure it will be worſe, there is a way ſhewed to take off the ſadneſs from your preſent Thoughts, and the real Danger that follows. What can be more unreaſonable then not to endeavour to avoid that, which every one may and is called upon to do. <hi>Caſt away from you all your Tranſgreſſions, whereby ye have tranſgreſſed, and make you a new Heart and a new Spirit: For why will ye<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> die O Houſe of</hi> Iſrael?

Whether you ſhall take up your everlaſting Habitation in Heaven or Hell, doth as nearly concern you, as now what you ſhall eat or drink, how to obtain ſuch a Profit or ſuch a Pleaſure, and avoid a loſs or inconvenience.

If People will ſtamp the Kings Coyn under foot, or are wilfully reſolved not to receive it, he will reſent and puniſh the Affront. The Lord and Governour of the World will not ſuffer without Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment himſelf to be diſ-regarded by Earth-Worms, who are as nothing in Compariſon of him: Judge your ſelves, whether it is equal?

The King who rules over us, hath the Subjection of the outward Man, in things pertaining to the Welfare and Peace of his Kingdom, and it is freely given him, though there is no other benefit, but to live for a while ſafely under his Protection, and that we think (as it is indeed) ſufficient. The Government of God reaches further to the Thoughts and Intents of the Heart, all one as Words and Actions, even the whole Man: But then it is for his preſent Peace, and he will reward him with eternal Happineſs hereafter, which none of our Maſters upon Earth would or can do. As much as God is greater then Man, ſo it is juſt his Command ſhould extend further; and yet if the Monarchs of ſeveral Nations were ſo deſpiſed by their reſpective Subjects as God is by us (to our ſhame be it ſpoken) but more eſpecially by the ungodly part of mankind; how would they take it? And God is pleaſed to declare that he will deal ſo with us, as we do with one another. The abomination of iniquity is ſet forth in Scripture by thoſe <hi>who ſay unto God, Depart from us; for we deſire not the knowledge of thy ways,</hi> Job 21. 14. <hi>By not regarding his Work, and deſpiſing his Word,</hi> Iſa. 5. 12, 24. ſo Pſal. 50. 17.

And then if they are the leaſt ſenſible or apprehenſive, What Fear and Horror are they in? What dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Thoughts do ariſe in their minds? They having not given Glory unto God, but on the contrary diſhonoured him, muſt be hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribly ſurprized about their Feet ſtumbling upon the dark Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains; as their Souls do look over into the other World, they ſhrink back and would fain ſtay where they are: Now a flaſhing

But ſome as they were diſobedient in their life time, are ſullen in their Death; or aſhamed and not willing to take diſcredit upon themſelves, for Pride goes out laſt with the body of ſin.

And who have ſtrove to conceal, yet ſudden words drop forth, and other ſigns manifeſt their ſad Condition. All their ſinful Pleaſures are vaniſhed away like ſmoke, and leave this blackneſs behind; If never ſo much hath been done to pleaſe Men, that ſignifies nothing, for they cannot ſupport him, they are under the ſame Law and ſhall not be able to deliver themſelves. The World and all things therein are paſſed away, what he hath done as to them ſtands in no ſtead, that was the Enemy which beguiled, now ſhrinks away, and leaves him in this fore<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

His body is to deſcend into the Bars of the Pit, which till the Reſurrection will be no more then a Stone or any other lump of Clay under the Earth, but where the Soul ſhall be received, is the Anguiſh and Vexation.

                  <hi>The end is come, it watcheth for thee,</hi> Ezek. 7. 6. It is ſtrange that the living will not take warning by what they ſee hath hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to others. Haſt thou known, or heard of any one that hath died in his ſins? All the pleaſure of them is gone, and the ſame thing with him as if it had not been at all as to the delightful Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Was he in an Agony or Stupid at the laſt? Doſt not thou think it would have been better for that ſame perſon, if he had lived in Holineſs and Righteouſneſs inſtead of Sin and Iniquity? For the fancied trouble, but the real delight of the former would have been paſt and gone, as the clamorous and outward Pleaſures, but the ſilent and inward Vexation of the latter now is. Then
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:46484:204"/> he would have had ſomething to truſt unto, but now he hath not. If thou continueſt in ſin (which God forbid) juſt the ſame will be thy Caſe: Whether thou mindeſt it or not, the day will come when thou ſhalt be like him. The Scripture teſtifies ſufficiently unto all that they do not thoſe things, <hi>the end of which is Death,</hi> Rom. 6. 21. To be wretched in this life and afterwards alſo is a ſad thing. What can be done too much to prevent either, but eſpecially the laſt? The firſt may be ſomewhat eaſed, the latter may be wholly taken away. And the only means to do it is by Submiſſion and Obedience unto Almighty God: That in this time which he hath given to prove us, we may be ſuch as he would have us be. All reaſonable Creatures are either obedient Subjects or Enemies. He holds all our breath in for a ſpace, he takes it away and we die: <hi>The Wicked is driven away in his wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, but the Righteous hath hope in his Death,</hi> Prov. 14. 32.</p>
               <p>Now that relies upon the promiſes of God, which are as ſure <note place="margin">The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of good Men in their Death.</note> as the Foundations of the Earth; <hi>He upholdeth all things by the word of his power,</hi> Heb. 1. 3. And alſo he doth ſupport the Faith of his Servants by the Word of his Truth. Innumerable are the places of Holy Scripture to give them the moſt perfect aſſurance that it ſhall be well with them after Death, as <hi>Mat. 25. 34, 40, 46. John 8. 51. John 3. 16. John 6. 33. John 12. 26. John 14. 2, 3, 19. John 20. 17. Rev. 14. 13. Phil. 1. 21, 22. Col. 3. 4. 2 Cor. 5. 1, 2, 3, 4. Rom. 8. 1, 15, 16, 17. 2 Cor. 1. 20. Eph. 1. 13, 14. 2 Tim. 4. 7, 8. Rom.</hi> 2. 7.

The Lord Chriſt muſt be a deceiver if theſe things be not ſo, rather then which in the leaſt to think I would ſay in good earneſt and upon deliberation, <hi>all Men are Lyars.</hi> With him my Soul is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to embarque for the Land of Eternity upon this perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and confidence, God muſt be good and true, He hath made known his Will concerning us Men by him, that is the <hi>true and Faithful Witneſs,</hi> who hath done it accordingly. <hi>God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed a day in the which he will Judge the World in Righteouſneſs by that Man whom he hath ordained, whereof he hath given aſſurance un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all Men in that he hath raiſed him from the Dead,</hi> Acts 17. 31.

In all our Glory we are not arrayed as the Lilies of the Field: Is it to ſhew our care by proviſion before hand for Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things? The Ants and Bees do the ſame, only we are found more unreaſonable, they lay up only for the Winter time, but we who know our ſelves Mortal, covet as if we were to abide here for ever. Is it meerly to ſport and play? The <hi>Leviathan</hi> takes his Paſtime in the deep. Is it only to keep company? There are ſome ſorts of Birds and Beaſts that continually flock and herd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, ſtill this is not all.

He hath provided other kind of things for us then we now ſee or have; Every one that is not Brutiſh in his Imagination doth find in himſelf Expectations after that which this World cannot give; ſomething that points out beyond the compaſs of the Earth, and the Deep ſaith, it is not in me. The good and allwiſeCreator will not couzen or beguile him with that which is not, will not always feed him with bare longings or falſe hopes.

I have heard it Talked and Whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered as if dead and gone, there is an end and no more. It was needful to ſay ſomewhat that theſe might in due time have perfect knowledge of another World before they are actually entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, for otherwiſe it is ſad and lamentable. And alſo that thoſe who have ſome belief, and not bare profeſſion, might be under a more lively ſence thereof, for this very much helps to ordering the converſation aright. Nay, who have all faith and come to the greateſt degree that uſually Men arrive unto, yet theſe have need ſtill to ſeek out further eſtabliſhment and confirmation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. God having reſerved that in Heaven, and it being not ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to a ſtate of Tryal, is pleaſed not to give unto any of us abſolute perfection in Spiritual Graces or natural accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Who hath received a faith which cannot be ſhaken, at leaſt in ſome of its Branches? It doth lie upon us all to make it as ſure as ever we can by the means given that it may help in time of need. When we come near to Death that is ſuch a time, the greateſt Temptation with whichSatan doth at laſt aſſail us, is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly to unbelief, taking advantage over bodily weakneſs and drooping. So that he who is wiſe will endeavour to lay up in ſtore againſt that time; and alſo it is neceſſary in the midſt of life, then indeed it may be accompanied with little doubts, but at laſt with deſperate plangings. It is requi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>No Man can be too well aſſured of the Truth of Scripture, and which is included in them a life to come: Let him endeavour ſtill to be more and more, for then he may ſecurely triumph over the laſt Enemy, Death, look it in the face and yet not be diſmay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: His buſineſs is, when he believes the Scriptures to be moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly true, to act accordingly, and then he is ſafe: When he can apply thoſe promiſes to himſelf in Truth, and without deceit, he is as ſure as i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Saith Chriſt, <hi>Whoſoever heareth theſe ſayings of mine and doth them, I will liken him unto a wiſe Man which built his Houſe upon a Rock, and the rain deſcended, and the flood came, and the Winds blew and beat upon that Houſe, and it fell not, for it was founded upon a Rock,</hi> Mat. 7. 24, 25. This he applyed to his whole Sermon on the Mount; Who doth obſerve that, particularly what is ſaid, <hi>Mat. 5. 19, 20, 29, Mat.</hi> 7. 21. Shall have this commendation in the mean
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:46484:205"/> while, and ſhall at laſt find it to be true to his endleſs comfort.</p>
               <p>But there is a deceit amongſt Chriſtians, who think if they can apply one ſingle Beatitude to themſelves, they are well enough. Indeed if they are ſo, not becauſe natural diſpoſition is more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to ſuch a Grace, but purely out of obedience to Chriſt and no other reaſon, the bleſſing may be theirs. And if they were ſo alone out of that Principle, the very ſame would oblige them to other things alſo. He that is careful to approve his Obedience ſincerely unto God, will do it in all things he requires, as well as ſuch a particular inſtance. If he is acted by love and ſubjection unto him, he will do a thing at his command contrary to natural inclination or fleſhly intereſt. In all the Law given us there is no exception left to the natural humours and deſires of Men, thoſe are to be contradicted and brought into Obedience. If ſome are more prone to this ſin, and again ſome to another kind, their forbearance and practice of the contrary duty will be more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent and have a proportionable reward. All Gods Precepts <note place="margin">Jam. 2. 10, 11. 1 Cor. 12. 8.</note> are linked together, But as in the Gifts of God, a Man hath the common meaſure of all, yet one is more eminent for this: So in Obedience and Chriſtian Graces one is obliged to all, but then a ſingle one ſhall ſhine forth more then the re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>This is not a needleſs digreſſion, for the Doctrine and Practice of Univerſal Obedience is neceſſary againſt the Fear and Danger of Death, as we learn from <hi>Ezek. 18. 31. 1 Cor.</hi> 15. 56. That gives title to all the promiſes: who complies therewith is ſure, and none beſides. <hi>Righteouſneſs delivereth from Evil,</hi> Prov. 11. 4.

It quickens to do whatever his hand finds to do with all his might, for there is no Labour nor Work in the Grave. There is but one
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:46484:206"/> of Tryal, the days paſs away, are accountable for, and do not return; this puts upon doing every thing to the utmoſt to have the favour and acceptance of Almighty God.</p>
               <p>The World judging by themſelves look upon thoſe as Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly, who are ſo wiſe to conſider their latter end. But is there no difference between the Righteous and Wicked? There is much in their manner of Converſation all the life long, and ſo is at their death. There is difference in Priſoners between the innocent and guilty as to their looking for the day of Aſſizes, and ſhall the laſt Judge of the comfortable expectation of the other by his own Fears and Dread? Becauſe ſome are afraid to appear before Chriſt, are they alſo who have the certain promiſe of Being with him? The one doth not live like the other, they are contrary in their Thoughts, Words and Actions before, their manner of Diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that vaſt and endleſs parting they muſt make one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. It is the greateſt Happineſs to the one, and miſery to the other, and therefore it may be well ſuppoſed to adminiſter diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent thoughts to them.</p>
               <p>It is impoſſible to obviate all the ſayings of Men, for they are endleſs, and moſt are ſo trivial that they do not deſerve any an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, but yet may be judged of by this one Obſervation, <hi>viz.</hi> There is nothing ſo good and true, but ſomething may be ſaid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it; Nothing ſo evil and falſe, but ſomething may be ſaid for it. But in every propoſition, let it ſeem never ſo true or ſtrange at firſt ſight, examine the Arguments of both ſides without pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice or partiality; and then that ſide which hath moſt reaſon and probability may determine our aſſent. This doth make for the honour and reality of Truth, that the reaſons whereby (in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring one thing from another) we come to know it, are clear, deep and convincing. Truth muſt prevail where it can be mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted; Which is of ſuch a Divine and excellent Nature that the whole doth not come forth on a ſudden, but hath been ſtrugling in the Womb ſome thouſands of Years. There is great oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to it by the powers of Darkneſs and their Sophiſtry, as may be ſeen; for the Objections againſt it are Dark, Perplex, Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory, Slight and deceiving. It is reciprocally ſo with falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, though it hath paſſed current and been a long time received. This may be applied to innumerable inſtances.</p>
               <pb n="395" facs="tcp:46484:206"/>
               <p>But to our purpoſe, The noble Martyrs of Old, did not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline Death in its moſt terrible ſhape when they might glorifie God and avoid ſin: they were called Melancholly, Sullen, Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate, Fooliſh, haters of Mankind and ſuch like. When they were in the very prime of Age, of excellent natural diſpoſition, of a vain converſation before and that changed by Chriſtianity in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a more happy manner of living, when they were wiſe and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood what they did as well as ever Men did, and did ſhew themſelves as ſincere and affectionate to one another. The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil is never wanting to ſet himſelf againſt the doings of God, to whiſper into the hearts of Men to hinder their Faith and return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto him; but then they run away with that, and will not conſider what can be ſaid on the other ſide; this is one cauſe of unbelief, the many objections and prejudices they have againſt the truth. They are reſolved to take up therewith, and not hear from themſelves or others a full ſatisfactory anſwer; Is the leaſt thing muttered againſt God? Their ears are open immediately, it is forthwith unanſwerable; But if ſpoken out for him, then <hi>like the deaf Adder they ſtop their Ears, and refuſe to hear the voice of the Charmer, charm he never ſo wiſely:</hi> They think it can never be wiſe that makes for Religion, as all things are which make againſt it. Whilſt they are willing, Satan ſhould hold them at this catch, it may be here applied, <hi>Becauſe they received not the love of the Truth that they might be ſaved, for this cauſe God ſhall ſend them ſtrong deluſion, that they ſhould believe a lye, that they all might be damned who believed not the Truth, but had pleaſure in unrighteouſneſs,</hi> 2 Theſ. 2. 10, 11, 12. They might conſider which was moſt ſafe, as well as moſt reaſonable to believe: In the likelieſt probability when ſuch multitudes of Men, Women (more fearful by nature) and young Men, who may ruſh upon Death in a heat of paſſion, or out of Gallantry and Honour, not with a deliberate adviſed mind, When it was eſteemed infamous and fooliſh by the World, yet ſtill to embrace it rather then ſin againſt God and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the Faith, this muſt be the power of his Grace which did arm their mind againſt all Fear of Death, both in its natural dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, and alſo heigthened by the malice and cruelty of Men.</p>
               <p>That was an extraordinary Caſe, but what is it to the Fear of Death now a days?</p>
               <pb n="396" facs="tcp:46484:207"/>
               <p>Very much, for though Men do not continue in the World by reaſon of Death, yet that ſtill continues. It reigned as an evil from <hi>Adam</hi> unto Chriſt: But now he hath taken away the ſting and frightful nature from it. When he made his Soul an offering for ſin, and took upon him the perſon of the Wicked he drunk of the Cup of Gods Wrath; Was there any ſuch love <hi>that he by the Grace of God ſhould taſte Death for every Man?</hi> Heb. 2. 9. Taking away that exceeding bitterneſs in it, for all thoſe who will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with the ends of his death; Who can withſtand ſuch good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? The full Cup was taken off, it matters not if a drop or two is left behind, that we may juſt reliſh how exceeding bitter it was to him. <hi>Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the ſin of the VVorld,</hi> John 1. 29. <hi>Even Jeſus which delivered us from the wrath to come,</hi> 1 Theſ. 1. 10.</p>

It is not thus always, for ſeveral things may ſtop the exerting forth of this Cheerfulneſs, yet what the Apoſtle ſaith is Peremptory and true, <hi>If any Man have not the Spirit of Chriſt, he is none of his,</hi> Rom 8. 9. And that will yield ſome Comfort, it doth ſhine in the Heart, though it may be darkned and over clouded: I would in no wiſe diſcourage any one, who hath ſincerity and the true Fear of God, who are willing to pleaſe him in all things, though their beginnings may be imperfect, <hi>For who hath deſpiſed the day of ſmall things?</hi> Zech. 4. 10. and yet are taken away, God will Judge according to the real Intentions, for this is accepted if it would indeed come forth into Act, as may be learned by compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 17. with <hi>Gen.</hi> 22. 10, 12.

But give me leave to put you in mind (and this is for the Comfort of good and bad, their Body being the ſame) not to be troubled about this thing; for there is no ſuch dreadfulneſs in it as we imagine. The Soul only is the Man, and the Body is but a Lump of Clay; when that is gone out, the other is no more to us, then now any common piece of Earth or Stone.

Our own Corps will be no more to us when dead, then that of another to us whilſt living. The Soul makes the difference, for though there be ſeveral ſorts of Complexion, Stature and ſuch other Accidents, yet there is no more between Bodies, then of one piece of Clay from another: <hi>I muſt ſhortly put off this Tabernacle,</hi> 2 Pet. 1. 14. ſo 2 Cor. 5. 1. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. It is Leaving of an Houſe for a time, which we do not mind longer then we are in, let it fall or ſink, afterwards we ſhall not feel that.

               <p>I deſire the Reader in this and other places, not to conclude any thing unanſwerable, becauſe here he doth not ſee a clear An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer unto it; for if I cannot, another may, and if he ſhould not, ſtill it is unjuſt, that the Truth of Divine Revelation, ſhould ſtand or fall by the weakneſs of a Man. Faith relies upon that, and not upon Humane reaſoning; however this may ſeem to make more probable the things we believe, yet they cannot be
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:46484:209"/> made ſo very certain, as to take off all manner of doubt: There is ſomething left to exerciſe the Faith of Gods Servants, for if it was evident with open Face and paſt Queſtion, <hi>What reward hath it?</hi> Immortality is plainly declared in the Scriptures, whereon the Promiſes of the Goſpel are founded. We have the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of God and his Son Jeſus Chriſt for it, and it is the Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of our Faith to cleave unto that, notwithſtanding all the objections of Fleſh and Blood to the contrary. <hi>I know whom! have believed,</hi> and he that made me at firſt out of nothing can raiſe me again out of Duſt and Aſhes; he that breathed into me the breath of Life can preſerve it when it is gone forth; it is eaſie for the Spirit to return to him that gave it. God works in a natural and ordinary way, as he firſt endued the Body with Life and Motion, faſhioning and uniting all its Parts, ſo he qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifies it for ſuch a long continuance. With the greateſt Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Reverence, by judging according to what is revealed, and that Reaſon himſelf hath been pleaſed to give, I conceive, That as in common Works the Artificer doth frame a Motion to laſt ſo long, It may be ſuppoſed, the Maker of all things doth the ſame as Man doth, to whom he hath given that knowledge. After the Springs and Wheels are ſet a going, it will move for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate time of it ſelf, and will not ceaſe unleſs by the hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance of ſome Accident. <hi>In God we live, and move, and have our being,</hi> Acts 17 28. It was he alone that gave all this to us, and even now holds our Souls in Life. At laſt he doth take away our breath and we die, yet he doth it always by ſome natural Cauſe.

Men cry out ſtill upon ſecond Cauſes, but yet they might look up unto him, who holds the firſt link in his hand of this great Chain of Things, who ſaith to this Diſeaſe, Go and cut down ſuch a Man, or elſe ſhake him. Who hath the diſpoſal and ordering of every Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident, who can withdraw his Protection, and let ſuch an Evil de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy us. <hi>Seeing his days are determined, the number of his Months is with thee, thou haſt appointed his bounds which he cannot paſs,</hi> Job 14. 5. Even Reaſon it ſelf doth manifeſt thus much, for a Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle always burning, if it be not blown out or waſted ſooner will laſt but ſuch a time. The Vital Spirits continue only ſo long, if

And therefore the <note place="margin">Pſal. 55. 23.</note> rule is certain, none goes beyond, but many come ſhort of their appointed time; to prevent which every one is in Duty bound to uſe means and all good Care. Life conſiſts in the Union of the Soul and Body, they are ſo near and interwoven, that whatſoever happens to the one, the other hath a touch and feeling thereof. So it is in time of Health, much more in Sickneſs; the one is ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of the Pain and Languiſhing of the other. But it can be in no wiſe concluded, that becauſe ſhe Sympathiſes, therefore ſhe doth die with the Body. The Spirit is the Light of the Body, it may waft up and down a little before its Separation, but is not to be ſeen. <hi>Who knoweth the Spirit of Man that goeth upward?</hi> Eccleſ. 3. 21.

So that in the mean while we may be aſſured, and at laſt have true and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain hopes of Reſurrection unto eternal Life. And there cannot be ſuch Fright and Amazement concerning that which is to make the everlaſting Deciſion, either when it is far off, or near at hand. If any one hath, let him ſearch and examine his Conſcience impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially; either he doth ſomething which he ought not to do, or he leaves ſomething undone which he ought to do, this makes him horribly afraid, and muſt be amended before he can be freed from the Danger, which the Fear gives warning of.</p>
               <p>A true Chriſtian can contentedly look for the bleſſed Hope, even in the midſt of Life he can find Comfort and ſweet in the thoughts of Death, as that which will free from the diſturbances of Fleſh and Blood, the Moleſtations of an unthankful, unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, ignorant World, from the Miſeries and Labours of Life, and ſend him over unto eternal Reſt and Rejoycing. To come to the Enjoyment of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, to be admitted into Fellowſhip with <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> Prophets, Apoſtles, Martyrs, all the Good and Wiſe Men ſince the World began, to be gathered unto his Fathers, to ſee his Godly Friends and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance of the ſame Generation with himſelf juſt gone before, all this muſt be a deſirable thing. The dead may be ſuppoſed to be about five hundred to one more then the living now are, thoſe whom thou leaveſt behind ſhall in a little time follow thee, and the People which ſhall be born ſhall die in like manner, and ſhortly God will accompliſh his whole Elect. None hath advantage, who goes before or after. And ſeeing the River muſt be gone over, it is ſmall difference who hath a longer or ſhorter Paſſage, ſo we avoid the Rocks and Dangers in the way. The pious Soul will be in a Strait willing to ſtay, and yet have a mind to go; and there is ſome Irkſomeneſs to leave the World, as now it is to change the place where we have long dwelt: Our Nature is ſomething made
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:46484:210"/> up of Contraries, willing and yet unwilling; but if God doth really ſend as we know not his Pleaſure until after the uſe of all prudent Remedies the Sickneſs proves unto Death, Fear not to go, for he calls thee. Remember that Petition thou haſt often made, <hi>Thy Kingdom come,</hi> and when it is, wilt thou then ſhrink back? One end of Sickneſs is to make us the more wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to leave the World. Whatever is ſudden, doth ſurprize for the time, but then it is ſoon over, whereas that which comes on by Degrees and expected, is longer, but then more eaſily born. Good Men have been divided in Opinion about this thing; thoſe who have been for a ſudden departure, have rightly thought, the only Preparation is by an holy Life, for the Goſpel ſpeaks of no other. It Commands to Watch, to have our Loyns girt, and our Lamps burning, and this is to be done in the midſt of Health, Life and Vigour. There is much Talk in the World about pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding for ones latter End, but unleſs to ſettle temporal Affairs from the example of <hi>Hezekiah</hi> there is not ſo much ſaid thereof throughout the whole Word of God. It is the beginning of Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror and Deceit, when People depart from that. It is Non ſenſe and Contradiction to the ſaying of our Saviour, <hi>John.</hi> 9. 4. to put off the working while <hi>it is day, till the night cometh when no Man can Work.</hi> Who purpoſely put off the working out their Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion till that time, had beſt have a great Care what they do, for beſides the hazard of being taken away by ſudden Death, yet if they ſhould have conſiderable time of Sickneſs, or Old decrepit Age; they have no ſuch Warrant of being accepted. Hear what God ſaith, <hi>Mal.</hi> 1. 8. of offering <hi>the Blind, the Lame, the Sick for Sacrifice.</hi>

               <p>But if ſome are againſt Death by the ordinary way of Sickneſs, becauſe that is tireſome, and may be an occaſion of murmuring Diſtruſt, Unbelief, blaſphemous Speeches, which proceed from violent Diſtempers, yet we ſhould not refuſe to ſuffer whatever God thinks fit to lay upon us. He knows our Condition, and will not enter into Judgment for the meer Sin of the Diſeaſe, no more then he imputes the Follies of Childhood. <hi>We are to receive for the things done in the Body,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 10. to be judged according to the general Tenour and Bent of our Life. Neither will our moſt merciful God take advantage of any infirmity or ſlip at the laſt. He will not ſuffer us for any Pains of Death to fall from him. The Church prays ſo for more abundant ſecurity, and alſo to deliver

We are to believe him to be true, and then all muſt be ſo which is contained in that Book.</p>
               <p>God doth encourage to his ſervice with a Reward; ſo that he who labours to pleaſe him acts after the very ſame manner, tho in a much more eminent and greater degree, as another who ſtudies to recommend himſelf to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

We may as well truſt God for the great things to come, and labour after them, as we do for our daily Food and thoſe little things that are preſent. And though he now gives common Mercies to the unthankful, yet they muſt uſe ſome means after them; but for the better hope, the exceeding great and precious promiſes of unſeen and future things, thoſe are only for them who glorifie him here, and ſeek after them. Faith makes theſe things as abſolutely true and certain as thoſe now before us; <hi>Whoſoever believeth on him ſhall not be aſhamed,</hi> Rom. 10. 11. <hi>Faith towards God</hi> is reckoned among <hi>the Principles of the Doctrine of Chriſt</hi> Heb. 6. It being that upon which not only thoſe there recited, but whatſoever is ſaid throughout the whole Book of God doth depend; Which whoſoever believeth ſtedfaſtly muſt neceſſarily be a Chriſtian, not in Name and Profeſſion, but in manner of Life; or otherwiſe he will act more unreaſonably and fooliſhly

               <p>The Scripture doth contain things to be believed, and things to be done: The firſt are comprized in a brief form of ſound Words, commonly called the <hi>Apoſtles Creed,</hi> which is believed as it ſtands upon certain and evi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

John 3. 15, 16, 17, 18, 36. Luke</hi> 6. 47. The great danger in not believing any Scripture is what the Apoſtle Speaks, <hi>He that believeth not God, hath made him a Lyar,</hi> 1 John 5. 10. Which is more provoking then living in known Sin and Wickedneſs. But this none that believes other things will dare to do; the General Queſtion and debate is what God intended in ſuch a place. It is agreed on both ſides of the Truth of ſome ſence and meaning, but what that is, is the riſe of controverſie and diſpute. <hi>In</hi> Paul's <hi>Epiſtles are things hard to be underſtood, which they that are unlearn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and unſtable wreſt, as they do alſo the other Scriptures unto their own deſtruction,</hi> 2 Pet. 3. 16.

               <p>It is ſad to reflect that the only thing neceſſary in Religion is the only thing neglected, how people fly about the skirts and borders, not coming into the ſubſtance thereof.

Men rightly think they muſt have ſomething to do with the things of God, and ſome falſly think theſe vain diſputations will ſerve the turn. Theſe are ſpeculative not falling upon luſt, and they hope a zeal for this one way or another (it is ſomething for God) and therefore ſhall come in for atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of other ſins; And in concluſion tends to that, he fain would ſave himſelf by condemning others. What elſe makes him ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary zealous for ſuch a way and againſt ſuch an opinion, when himſelf in the mean while lives in Habitual ſin and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs, which is more dangerous to Souls then errours of the underſtanding, if they were really ſuch? Here ſome drive on an intereſt of their own, but who do not, are led by ſuch an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſive cauſe. In thoſe that have ſet up for Guides and Teachers there hath been, <hi>Doting about Queſtions and Strifes of words, whereof cometh Envy, Strife, Railing, evil Surmiſings, perverſe diſputings of Men of corrupt minds, and deſtitute of the Truth, ſuppoſing that gain is Godlineſs,</hi> 1 Tim. 6. 4, 5. This was their end, but the ſilly people were by them told that was moſt for Salvation, which made for their own profit, and thus they have came to that height of zeal and giddineſs. Do they not place more in their petty diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences then in the weightier matters of Law? <hi>Judgment, Mercy and love of one another:</hi> That all this is a meer deluſion may be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſeen, becauſe it quite vaniſhes when the Man approaches near to Death, and apprehends things according to ſincerity and Truth.</p>
               <p>How earneſtly doth the Apoſtle expreſs himſelf againſt theſe diſputes even at their firſt beginning, <hi>Rom. 14. 1.

Shattering, if not making to fall the foundation of Faith and good manners; How Religion is as it were turned into an endleſs prate and talk about contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted points.

The Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels, Scorners, Carnal and indifferent Perſons have been confirmed in their ungodlineſs, thinking it as good to be of no Religion at all, as to profeſs one with ſo much wrangling. They make ſport with the Abſurdities, and fallings out of the Religious. Alſo the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites and Adverſaries under the ſhelter of them, do throw out their Reproaches; and hereupon the Preſumption of them which hate God, increaſeth yet more. Whereas it might be conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that notwithſtanding they differ and ſquabble, yet they all agree in this, That Obedience and Holineſs is the only way to Heaven. If they contend about Circumſtantial and poſitive Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, it is about the manner; In this they concenter, that God is to be Worſhipped: And they all ſtand up with one accord for the Moral part, the immutable Laws of Good and Evil.</p>
               <p>There hath been an expedient propoſed, and only wants to be put in uſe; if what ſome would Arrogantly have in their Church, be it no wiſe granted to them, but (what is moſt reaſonable and due) that there ſhould be an implicit Belief in Scripture, the Word of God. In all plain places believe them as they are, but in the hard and difficult ſo believe in general, whatever the Holy Spirit did intend was the very meaning of that place. Whoſoever believes thus much, ſhall certainly be ſaved. Nor doth this ſhut out knowledge and induſtry, for that is a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Duty, but after that uſed to reſt in what we apprehend the meaning, and that if any other is, ſo we believe it, See 1 <hi>Cor. 2. 10, 11. Phil. 3. 15. Pſal.</hi> 25. 12, 13, 14. The way to Truth is by good Life, and direction from above. God is Gracious and Merciful, he threatens none but only thoſe who ſhall not believe on him, and his Son Jeſus Chriſt. All Ignorances, Errors and Miſtakes that are neither wilful nor affected will be pardoned. Let no Man lay any other Foundation, and every one keep faſt to that. There is a great ſtir about an infallible Judge of Controverſie, and an unerring interpreter of Scripture. Whereas the common and ordinary places do no more need any Interpretation, then every common expreſſion; of this Nature is moſt part of the Goſpel, but for the Myſteries and dark Speeches throughout Holy Writ, God will unfold and bring them to Light in his due time. We ought to pray, and through his Grace endeavour to be meet for the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit which ſearcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 2. 10. We are to ſet our Seal that God is true, and ſo is every

God may reveal many things in Succeſſion of time, and what he doth not, none ſhall miſ-carry for not knowing them. The Promiſe is annexed to Obedience and not Opinion: do this and live: Yea, Faith it ſelf is in order to Practice, <hi>

And whoſoever doth really believe that he was ſent from God, if he is fully and effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually perſwaded, that thoſe things are ſo which our Saviour hath made known, that Perſon can never live ill if he let them ſink deep into his Heart.

We do err and wander of our ſelves, ſeeking out for green Paſture, for thoſe fooliſh and ſinful Delights which we know not would rot and deſtroy us. We would ſain be Happy as ſoon as poſſible, then that luſcious and preſent appearance of good doth draw us away after it: Did none take Care of us but our ſelves, we muſt be conſumed in this our Folly; for we go away from the Supream and only Good, and ſnatch at thoſe things which are hurtful. It pleaſes the Lord to put before us the good and the evil to prove whither we will be obedient unto him: Whether

We will not believe his Word, for we would willingly have ſome Tryal by experience, whether it be ſo or not. We are not contented to truſt unto his Goodneſs and Truth, but for knowing of our ſelves. What ingratitude, Contempt and diſ-belief do we ſhew unto God, who is ſo infinitely above us? What unparralled Condeſcention and Goodneſs is in him, that he ſhould be pleaſed to ſuffer it in this Wiſe? When not only by the Excellenc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

We cannot go back of our ſelves, he ſends his Son and Biſhop of our Souls, who is <hi>the way,</hi> John 4. 6. ſo we may know it; he ſends his Holy Spirit to ſtir and puſh us forward, ſo that we may do it. If that when it is fully known what is the utmoſt good in all the Pleaſures of Sin, when not withſtanding all their vain Promiſes the Man is fully convinced of the Hunger and Emptineſs of them. When he is <hi>ready to periſh,</hi> Luke 15. 17. for want of true Satisfaction and Content, and might have more in the ways of God; if then he would return and come over unto him, it is accepted. Read and conſider well the third Chapter of <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> eſpecially <hi>Verſe</hi> 1, 7, 12, 13, 22.</p>
               <p>It is the great Aggravation of the Sin of Apoſtacy, concerning which the Apoſtle ſpeaks ſo dreadfully. Heb. 6. 4, 5, 6. and Chapter 10. 26, 27. <hi>Who were once enlightened and taſted of the Heavenly Gift, and were made Partakers of the Holy Ghoſt, and have taſted the good VVord of God, and of the Powers of the VVorld to come, If they ſhall fall away:</hi> When one formerly hath had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of the ways of Sin, and then by Converſion hath full experience of the ways of God, to fall away again from them is to pronounce on Satans ſide, that he is the beſt Maſter, as who hath judged of both, and then reſolvedly with Deliberation to determine for him; which muſt be an exceeding Provocation to the Divine Majeſty. In like manner the next Degree to that is, when one hath perceived to the utmoſt all the Delights of Sin and Vanity; when he hath went from Flower to Flower, and is either wearied in the Range, and by inſufficiency of ſome, may be fully perſwaded of the like in the reſt; yet ſtill to cleave unto theſe nauſeating empty and deluding Follies, to ſeem to give
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:46484:217"/> Gods word the Lye which ſpeaks of the Miſery and Deceitfulneſs of them, by owning the Happineſs of them when he is convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to the contrary; to refuſe to be reformed; to ſhew himſelf deſpitefully and diſdainfully againſt the ways of Holineſs, to give no Credit to the real good that is in them, or when he aſſents there is not to follow after them, but keep the preference to Old dreggy Luſts, making his boaſt of them; to ſtick unto Harlots when <hi>their Skirt is uncovered,</hi> and the Filthineſs of them fully known, yet to eſteem them before the true <hi>Beloved, the chiefeſt of ten Thouſand:</hi> When he hath ſufficiently found how little Fruit there is in thoſe things, whereof he was at firſt aſhamed, but ſtill continues in them, and hardens his Face: When he is told, <hi>the end of them is Death:</hi> When for ſome conſiderable time ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to make a true and impartial Deciſion, and <hi>by reaſon of uſe he hath had his Senſes exerciſed to diſcern good and evil,</hi> and he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains in the laſt ſtill: when all theſe things have been done, and yet he perſeveres wilfully and ſtubbornly to follow them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Commands and forbidding of his Maker: All theſe are ſad Signs and Prognoſticks, that ſuch an one will never come to Repentance, but it is juſt with God after repeated Provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of this manner to give him over to <hi>vile Affections,</hi> and then he may dote upon his Deſtruction, and be utterly eſtranged from the way of Salvation.</p>
               <p>It is neceſſary to conſider the Nature and end of things in order to ſtate them aright, many Souls have periſhed by mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes and falſe Notions of Repentance: Who have fallen from this Plank and been drowned in the Waters, which would have carried them into the Promiſed Land, if they had relied upon the whole, inſtead of a part thereof; or had not ſuffered it to ſlip from them by intending to lay hold on it, but were not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, it being gone too far from them.</p>
               <p>To prevent as much Danger for the future as may be, to have this ſure and ſtedfaſt, let the Reader be once more put in mind whereof he hath read or heard often, that the word in the Greek Language <hi>Metanoia,</hi> by which Repentance is ſignified in the New Teſtament, imports a Change of mind, and is expreſſed in words at length, <hi>Rom. 12. 2. Gal. 6. 15. Eph. 4. 22, 23, 24. 2 Cor.</hi> 5. 17. It is Superfluous, but yet ſafe to ſet down, though the Obſervation hath been ſo often made already of <hi>Metamelia</hi> and <hi>Metanoia</hi> in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 8, 9. Where <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of himſelf, I did repent, that is, I

Repentance in the Old Teſtament is ſeldom named, but is intended by that Phraſe of <hi>turning away from your iniquities,</hi> to this give all the Prophets wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which might be done as to the outward Act. The Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> goes further, <hi>Let the wicked forſake his way, and the unrighteous Man his Thoughts,</hi> Iſa. 55. 7. but the Goſpel in a more eſpecial manner is a <hi>diſcerner of the thoughts and intents of the Heart,</hi> and makes uſe of this word Repentance which reaches to the very ground of it. So that it is not a bare ceaſing to ſpeak or do Evil, and retaining affection to the ſame in the Soul; but that muſt be altered into a real diſlike and hatred of Evil.

Let nothing be ſaid here, or in any other place to exclude that growth and Proficiency of the Chriſtian Life, for that (as none of Gods Works are done of a ſudden) with the beginnig, increaſe and exerciſe thereof is the great end of our abiding in this World.

God forbid on the one hand, any thing ſhould be ſaid to give Licenſe or Encouragement to Sin; ſo again on the other, let all things be done for the Hope and Conſolation of all thoſe, who will come in due time and accept of Mercy. This being the peculiar Priviledge of poor mankind, and the means which our moſt merciful God hath ordained to ſave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from the Wrath to come, far be it from me or any other to ſhorten the extent of it, or to preſcribe exactly at what time, or to what pitch of abhorrence and Contrition it muſt be; Even ſuch as our Supream Judge will be pleaſed to accept of.

But however, hath not the leaſt doubt or fear of future Evils; which is a very conſiderable difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Righteous and the Wicked. Repentance firſt brings into this happy ſtate, frees from the Spirit of errour and giddi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, makes him to leave off thoſe unſatisfactory Vanities, ſuffers him not to be ſtill deluded with falſe Imaginations, tedious travel, and after all Vexatious diſappointment. When by reaſon of the pain and inſufficiency that is in all things of this World there is an utter deſpair of Happineſs, this ſhews him where it is. <hi>My heart and my fleſh faileth, but God is the ſtrength of my heart and my portion for ever,</hi> Pſal. 72. 26. We know him as yet by Faith, and our rejoycing in him is according to the meaſure of that. Whatever good and comfort is in pure and undefiled Religion, in an univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal and conſtant complyance with it, which is much every way (as may be partly ſeen by what hath been, and is to be ſaid) but much more would be perceived by him who makes a through experience of it; all this comes in by repentance, which is the beginning thereof, for it forſakes ſin and keeps the Commandments.</p>
               <p>This was the firſt Doctrine <hi>John</hi> the forerunner and Chriſt himſelf Preached, <hi>Mark.</hi> 1. 4, 15. And it was alſo the meſſage in which the Prophets before came; <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpeaks very little there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. <hi>He that deſpiſed</hi> Moſes <hi>Law died without Mercy,</hi> Heb. 10. 28. God gave his people at firſt ſevere and ſtrict Commandments without making ſo full a diſcovery of Pardon and Forgiveneſs, but then thoſe who became obnoxious to the guilt and judgment of the Law, did not know how to eſcape. The Lord who is rich in Mercy, did in time reveal it more and more to thoſe who would turn from their evil doing. Before the laſt threatning there goes out another warning and invitation to ſubmit, <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, Behold I frame evil againſt you, and deviſe a device againſt you, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn ye now every one from his evil way, and make your ways and your doings good, and they ſaid there is no hope, but we will walk after our own devices, and we will every one do the imagination of his evil heart,</hi>
                  <pb n="424" facs="tcp:46484:221"/> Jer. 18. 11, 12. Strange Stubbornneſs! that Men ſhould be thus provoking to God, and act ſo madly againſt themſelves; we ſee what a mighty force there is in Luſt and Pride. They ſinned yet more in not believing his wonderful offer, they incenſed him yet more in not being overcome by his goodneſs, but he abounded in this as they did in iniquity, confirming the truth of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, <hi>Let favour be ſhewed to the wicked, yet will he not learn Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,</hi> Iſa. 26. 10. All Gods doings are gradual and ſucceſſive, both his Works of Nature and Grace: The moſt ineſtimable and accompliſhment of all Mercies was in the Redemption of the World by our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; of this diſcovery was made to the Fathers by little and little. If I may ſo ſpeak with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt reverence and adoration with thanksgiving, for ſuch his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Methods, God ſhewed himſelf the moſt hard Maſter at firſt. The Law given, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 17. was peremptory and penal, then he begins, <hi>Gen. 8. 21. &amp; Gen.</hi> 9. to releaſe off his ſeverity, and then to <hi>Moſes</hi> he proclaims himſelf <hi>Merciful and Gracious, long Suffering,</hi> Exod. 34. 6. But yet did not ſo fully make known to him the Doctrine of Repentance as he did afterwards to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets. Then comes <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. 2, 3. Afterwards <hi>He</hi> (who was bringing into the World ſo long before, and to whom all the Old Teſtament hath Relation) <hi>came Preaching the Goſpel of the Kingdom of God, and ſaying, the time is fulfilled, and the Kingdom of God is at hand, Repent ye and believe the Goſpel,</hi> Mark 1. 14, 15. And now it is eſtabliſhed for all perſons, times and places, as appears, <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 46. Man muſt not preſume to ſin yet more, upon hopes of more Mercy; <hi>For as Chriſt was once offered to bear the ſins of many, and unto them that look for him ſhall he appear the ſecond time without ſin unto Salvation,</hi> Heb. 9. 28. So for thoſe who deſpiſe and ſin wilfully, there is a dreadful threatning, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 26, 27, 28, 29. <hi>God now commandeth all Men every where to repent, Becauſe he hath appointed a day in the which he will judge the World in Righteouſneſs by that Man whom he hath ordained, whereof he hath given aſſurance unto all Men in that he hath raiſed him from the dead,</hi> Acts 17. 30, 31.

The Book of <hi>Deuteronomy</hi> is wholly on this ſubject; there is ſcarce one Chapter throughout the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> the Pſalms, Prophets, Goſpel and Epiſtles, but hath ſomewhat rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to this.

And therefore if they practiſe Righteouſneſs or Temperance, though they will ſpeak out to the World that they do it for Health or Reputation, and if they have a little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to God in the heart they refuſe to utter that. They will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare openly, they do ſuch a thing becauſe the King or ſome Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour enjoyn them to do it, but either through baſhfulneſs or pride on which that is founded, will not make it known that they do ſuch things, becauſe it is the Commandment and Will of God. They may talk of the faſhionable Vertue, but not of <hi>Grace.</hi> They will ſpeak in the Words of <hi>Seneca,</hi> but not the <hi>Language of Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an;</hi> but if they have a ſerious mind to get the favour of God and be ſaved, let them conſider what is Written, <hi>Joel 2, 26.

The reaſon of things is to be attended unto. Our God whom we ſerve is a Jealous God, and his Glory he will not give unto another; So is he more pleaſed with Mens Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence when it is pure, uncorrupt, and nothing a ſharer with it.

But they cannot by outward violence, they may bring one like a Beaſt to the Sacrifice, but ſtill there is nothing of the ſubjection of the mind. God cares not for Hypocritical Services, or a bare outward Submiſſion; He may as well be glorified in Beaſts, the Blood of ſlain Bullocks of Goats, for there is a ſubjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of thoſe Creatures even unto Death. The Brute is knocked down before the Lord, but he is better pleaſed when the Will of a free and reaſonable Creature is Obedient unto his Will. When we do not follow our own ways in oppoſition to the guide of the Lord: When ſelf-will is not cringed unto, but the Word of God complyed withal.</p>
               <p>He created all things for his own Glory, and Man the Principal inhabitant of the Earth cannot ſhew it forth in a more excellent way. Let him offer up every Creature for a Sacrifice, do more then <hi>Solomon</hi> did to ſet forth the Magnificence of his Temple, yet he adds nothing to what God had before, <hi>for the VVorld is mine and the fulneſs thereof,</hi> Pſal. 50. 12. The merciful God delights not in the blood of dumb Creatures, he received them only as ſome atonement for Mans tranſgreſſion, and as a type of that great Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice which was once offered for all. Herein he ſhewed Mercy that he would accept of the life of a Beaſt for a more noble offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; Sacrifice and burnt Offerings thou wouldſt not, but the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of thy will. He is ſubject to no neceſſities, imperfection or low deſires, and therefore thouſands of Gold and Silver are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to him, they are his own already; He did firſt create, and now diſpoſeth of them; but there is ſomething ſtill, which I do in no wiſe ſay, he hath put out of his own power, yet he is pleaſed not to accept of it unleſs freely beſtowed. <hi>My Son give

He ſeems to long for it, and that for their good; for he who hath ſo much already and will be likewiſe glorified on them if they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe, cannot receive any addition by ſo ſmall a Mite. It is only that another ſhould do all things to obey him.</p>
               <p>Yet wretched and froward Man who knows not, nor will be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded what is for his good, who would fain be reconciled unto God, a Being ſo much above, and mightier then he, though it be more out of fear and ſelfiſhneſs then love, for that he is willing to give any thing rather then the right one; with what anguiſh and earneſtneſs, but upon miſtaken Grounds doth he expoſtulate? <hi>Will the Lord be pleaſed with thouſands of Rams, or ten thouſand Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of Oyl? Shall I give my firſt born for my Tranſgreſſion, or the fruit of my body for the ſin of my Soul? He hath ſhewed thee, O Man what is good, and what doth the Lord require of thee, but to do Juſtice and to love Mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God,</hi> Mic. 6. 7, 8. Then thou muſt ſubmit thy Will unto his Will. Many do offer up the Sacrifice of Praiſe, uſe much Devotion, will beſtow liberally Alms to the poor, frankly part with their Money, but not their Luſts, make a ſhew of Subjection unto God, yet keep their own Humours, and will not caſt down imaginations and every high thing that exalteth it ſelf againſt the Obedience of Chriſt; yet this one thing is more then them all, and which God principally inſiſts upon. He that Prayes, gives Thanks, or receives the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament doth he them out of Obedience? Then that is to oblige him to other things of Duty. Doth he not them to the intent that he may be better enabled to this? Or is he determined not to do this, and put God of with only begging Pardon? When a matter is in Controverſie, and the adverſe party will not give it up unto him who hath Power and Right on his ſide, but think to come of by asking formal Forgiveneſs for the Omiſſion.

Not conſidering what the great Provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of ungodlineſs is, and they do miſtake in not ſeeing the firſt Reaſon of the Commandments of God: Which in Truth are for the welfare of mankind, but this is not all; for the good or inconveniences, conſequent to the Obſervation or Violation of them, as pertaining to ſhort-lived mankind, do not Riſe ſo high as to have or deſerve eternal Rewards or Puniſhments. The Act of Sin is ſmall and weak, but <hi>the ſtrength of Sin is the Law,</hi> 1. Cor. 15. 56. It receives the Aggravation from going againſt that High and Divine Authority which hath eſtabliſhed things ſo: For it is too much a fond and proud Opinion, that all things are for our ſelves, if I do neither harm to my Neighbour nor my Self, and I commit Sin, What great Evil is in it?

When God delivered his Law in that terrible manner on <hi>Mount Sinah</hi> the People were afraid, that they ſaid unto <hi>Moſes, Speak thou with us, and we will Hear,</hi> Exod. 20. 19. and it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed further, <hi>We will hear, and do it,</hi> Deut. 5. 27. This way our Fore fathers choſe, and accordingly he did during his Life-time, and left written a Copy of the Law which ſhould be for ever. Moſes <hi>of Old time hath in every City them that Preach him, being read in the Synagogues every Sabbath day,</hi> Acts 15. 21. He was both Preached and Read. <hi>The</hi> Jews <hi>received the Law by the Diſpoſition of Angels, and have not kept it,</hi> Acts 7. 53. But Chriſtians recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it from a Greater, even the Son of God himſelf, and have not obeyed it. Chriſt hath thoſe who continually Preach him as <hi>Moſes</hi> had, by how much he is not only greater then him, but the very Angels of God. And receiving it immediately from his Father, he came down and made it known upon Earth. Who had <hi>a Voice out of the Cloud, which ſaid, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleaſed: Hear ye him,</hi> Mat. 17. 5.

Who though he is long ſince aſcended on High, and ſits at the right hand of the Father, yet ſpeaks to us even now by his Word, <hi>He that rejecteth me and receiveth not my Words, hath one that judgeth him, the VVord that I have ſpoken, the ſame ſhall judge him at the laſt day,</hi> John 12. 48. And if we will not hear them, neither

He hath ſent forth Labourers into his Harveſt with full Power and Commiſſion, <hi>He that heareth you, heareth me: And he that deſpiſeth you, deſpiſeth me; and he that deſpiſeth me, deſpiſeth him that ſent me,</hi> Luke 10. 16.

When any thing is deſigned for the good of mankind, he will be ſure to hinder it as much as he can. And it is obſervable among all the parts of Religion: None hath been ſo much ſtifled, refuſed or corrupted as the Ordinance of Preaching. Nothing is more muttered againſt, or endeavoured to be put off as the Faithful handling and Application of the Word. The great prejudice againſt it is Luſt, and Conſequent to that an affected ignorance. Seeing Men will not do accordingly, they think it the better the leſs they know or hear of the things of God; whereas this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wilful and out of a wicked mind, makes their Diſobedience yet worſe, becauſe they add this as the beginning and cauſe of all, <hi>They deſire not the knowledge of Gods ways,</hi> Job 21. 14. <hi>Thou hateſt inſtruction, and caſteth my words behind thee,</hi> Pſal. 50. 17. This is the principal Device Satan makes uſe of to deceive the whole World, by falſe and ſly Suggeſtions he keeps them off from being acquainted with the Way and Truth of God, and thence ſprings up a ſecret Enmity in the firſt place againſt the Word, and thoſe who divide it aright, giving to every one his Portion. There is none grown up to that height of wickedneſs, as to belch out Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies againſt Heaven, or ſpeak openly againſt Scripture; yet in the Heart of the natural Man doth lie hid an Hatred, and this ſhews it ſelf by oppoſing them, who are ſet in defence of the Goſpel. The real cauſe is concealed, but then he Picks ſome little Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or ſeeks out for occaſion (as that may eaſily be done by an evil mind) to Speak or Act againſt them.

It is not ſo much taken notice of, becauſe it ſutes with their Humours and Inclinations: For want of Love they think his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments grievous when delivered aright and preſſed home to the Conſcience. It is obſervable, the Spirit of God ſpeaks very much of the above-mentioned Corruption, but little or nothing againſt thoſe ſevere and rigid Men, againſt whom the World crys out ſo much, See <hi>Iſa. 9. 16.

If they would inſiſt on thoſe Motives which flow from the Word of Truth, and let them run with their due Cogency, we ſee here what would have been the Effect of it. The foregoing words are, <hi>In the latter days ye ſhall conſider

               <p>What could God have done more for his Vineyard then he hath done? His Decrees and Diſpenſations concerning mankind are righteous, He hath done things ſufficient for them to be Happy and avoid Miſery. Only he hath permitted them as free and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Creatures to Act of themſelves. He doth move and ſtir up their Wills to that which is good; Thoſe whom his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence ſuffers to be Paſtors, He prompts by his Spirit to be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in that Truſt repoſed in them. To the hearers are committed the lively Oracles, their own Conſcience, there is the opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of good Books and Converſation with other helps and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages which might be improved for the benefit of mankind. But the only thing is, they are not forced, and it is expected what they do, it ſhould be with a willing mind; conſidering which they have Aſſiſtances ſufficient to work out their own Salvation. God hath been pleaſed to eſtabliſh all things in an orderly way. What pertain to his Kingdom over the Sons of Men, have their Rules and their appointed means, and his Bleſſing doth always Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany them. He doth not work Miracles, where the thing may be done in a way he hath already ſhewed. <hi>To turn the Hearts of the Fathers unto the Children, and the Diſobedient to the VViſdom of the juſt, to make ready a People prepared for the Lord,</hi> Luke 1. 17. He gives his Word, Spirit and Miniſters. By the help of them, and putting forth the ſtrength God hath given us, all this may very well be accompliſhed. As the great Super-intendent in his Works of Nature hath left them to go in their Courſe, ſo in his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Grace which is over the Souls of Men, he hath ordained alike Method to ſpring forth and increaſe by appointed means.</p>
               <p>The great and only buſineſs which hath paſſed between God and Men, is concerning their Obedience in this World, and their Salvation in that which is to come. And therein may be obſerved from the very firſt Creation of them a moſt wiſe contrivance of things on Gods part; but the utmoſt folly, giving back and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion on ours. Had we conſented and for us performed what
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:46484:227"/> we might have done, there had been no ſeparation between God and us, which our iniquities have now made. Wilful ignorance and ſloth hath occaſioned this evil, by not improving the Talent, but hiding it in a Napkin. Would any one act according to the grace and power given him, and according to the way ſhewed, he ſhall never miſcarry: <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath made up for <hi>Adams</hi> Tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, ſo that the Lord being our helper, we may do the things well-pleaſing in his ſight, if our ſelves will ſincerely ſet to do them. God is faithful, and would not try our Obedience by more then we are able to perform; he gives aid, and offers more if we would but ſeek and make uſe of it. Doth any one deſire to be ſaved? Who doth not? Why then there is no more required but his real working together with the grace of God, and according to his means. It is aſtoniſhing to conſider, that ſeeing God hath given all thoſe great and powerful Arguments to ſtir up Man to his Duty, and then all the faculties of his Soul have a tendency towards it; yet ſo few are brought over to a right ſence and univerſal practice of Religion. But Satan trys all ways to drive them off, and then is their own averſation through corrupt nature to the things of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but here again, if they would conſult his Word, they would not be ignorant of thoſe devices of the Enemy, which might be rendred ineffectual, and then by ſtriving contrary and giving di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, that aver<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Some do needleſly inquire concerning the number of thoſe that ſhall be ſaved. When the Queſtion was asked our Lord, <hi>Luke</hi> 13. 23, 24. he gives no direct anſwer to it, but commands to take care for themſelves; and if every one did ſo, there would be no need to ask ſuch a Queſtion.

He is afraid, and dares not conſider of the Arguments which enforce the ſame, for then he would be converted and healed; and therefore it is not without cauſe the ſubtle Enemy la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours ſo much to hinder from that.

The great controverſie in the World is, Whether Men ſhould obey the Law of God, or the Law of Sin; Whether they ſhall do according to his Will, or be Maſter of their own Actions. None will deny that God is to be obeyed, nor can they gain-ſay againſt his Law which is Good, Juſt and Reaſonable, this is allowed of even by the tranſgreſſour: But then for follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his own courſe, he hath ſome fancies which are kept ſecret within himſelf, and are at the very bottom of his mind, which with him do weigh down thoſe general Conſiderations.

               <p>It is granted by all that the Bible is the moſt wiſe and excellent Book in the World; all Chriſtians acknowledge it to be the very Word of God, and thoſe who have either ſtudied or taught Holy Things refer all to that.

Who omit the one thing needful, and ſeek after every thing they may turn into nice ſpeculation or vain jangling.

The Pillar and Ground of Truth ſeems to ſhake
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:46484:231"/> by thoſe high, tottering and needleſs Superſtructions. Thoſe School-niceties have made to be thought more incredible the things we believe The Abſurdities and Fopperies of Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition, have ſtrangely prejudiced againſt the very Worſhip of God. That Controverſie and Humour of diſputing, have called the Fundamental Truths into queſtion, it being an eaſie inference for ignorant Souls to deny that in which the Contenders are not agreed; and to conclude all is feigned and falſe, becauſe Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Corruptions are ſo. That ſquabbling about trifles, hath very much taken off from the Gravity of Religion, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcerning People have thence imagined it a light thing.</p>
               <p>An Enemy doth craftily work in the minds of Men; but it is their Sin and Folly, that when they do already or might know this, yet ſtill they are inſtrumental in carrying on his deſign. That wiſe Men ſhould be taken in this Snare, as it is a ſign of his exceeding ſubtlety; ſo of their inconſideration and want of Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, for this is another thing then what is commonly called Wiſdom. When thoſe who ſhould turn many to Righteouſneſs, turn aſide to vain jangling; inſtead of inſtructing and exhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them in the few things to be believed, and many things to be done, they fill the Head with idle Opinions, confound with end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Arguings, and not touch upon Practice, but in a general and ſuperficial way, here is a Stratagem to deceive themſelves, and thoſe that hear them. Beſides the word of Truth, which doth clearly convince of this miſtake, they might look into themſelves, attend unto the frame and deſire of their own Soul, for that aſpires after Happineſs and Perfection, having a Complacency in thoſe things which tend to it, and a diſlike of the contrary. It gladly receives all Divine and ſubſtantial Truths to be nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up by them, and ſhews an Averſation to what doth not mediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or immediately promote this end. As an Evidence of its im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality, it earneſtly deſires after thoſe things which are not to be found here, but have Relation to an endleſs Life. She is for knowing thoſe things which are to be known, that ſhe may fix upon Reſt and bleſſed Expectation, be ſafe as to the doubtful uncertainty, and have ſtrong hopes for better things hereafter. Then ſhe is truly pleaſed when things are done in purſuance to this great end. She craves after knowledge and truth as the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach after food, but in Diſputings it is long before attained, and then proves hungry and empty: Whereas the practical and uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:46484:232"/> kind is both ſutable and ſatisfies the underſtanding. One may run over many Volumes of Controverſie, and yet neither be wiſer nor better; and perhaps he had a more true and clear apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the thing in Diſpute, then after he ſees it ſo perplexed and obſcured. The neceſſary Truths explicitly to be believed, are few and plainly revealed; and further in all Myſteries, a Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivating of Reaſon unto the Obedience of Faith is more accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in the ſight of God, then curious prying into unſearchable things. One may be ſooner ſaved in a general belief and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Practice, then by minutely Conteſting about every thing, and a general obſervance of Gods Law; which as it is commonly inculcated and uſed, is next to downright Diſobedience.</p>
               <p>In Truth all Men are in an imperfect State, but then they Act only half way of their imperfection, and will not ſtretch that out as they might. Let them wind up to the very top their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Action. Would Man uſe the Powers of Soul accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that degree God hath given and put them forth, he could never miſs of Happineſs. If he would lift up his Eyes, and ſee beyond the common end of things, think of ſomething that may be after this ſhort time, be as deſirous of future Happineſs and Safety, as he is of preſent Good and Conveniency which ſlides away; then he may do what he ſhall judge fit to be done. If we would put the queſtion to our immortal Soul, (as we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the Body, which fades as a Leaf) What will it avail me, to teach or ſtudy this or that thing, when I ſhall put off this Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle?

Whereas indeed their own Sins and Enmity through wicked Works, their own deadneſs in Treſpaſſes and Sins which cannot endure to be quickened, is the occaſion of this diſturbance; which alſo would ceaſe, if they were truly repented of and forſaken: But if retained, there Springs up Hatred, unkind uſage to the true Miniſters of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, not caring for their Company, ſpeaking Evil of them, fancying them as Tyrants, who are Men of like Paſſions with our ſelves, that are willing to take part with the Condition of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and have a Compaſſionate reſentment of it. But they dare not be unfaithful, and turn againſt him, who hath ſent them. They know and endeavour to appeaſe the living God, They muſt declare whatever he Commands in his Word.

Now it is evident, they ſhould be faithful in this Work of the Lord, and alſo diſcover what hinders the Accommodation, that it may be taken away, and then the buſineſs is done. It is not to lead People on in a bare outward Profeſſion, or a partial Obſervation of the Law, but to bring them over unto univerſal Obedience.

He that is ſent a Miniſter of Chriſt's Church did never deſcend into the deep, nor hath he ſeen any of thoſe dreadful things of the invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible World. He is only to make known and proclaim what he finds in the written Word of God. Who conſidering his infinite Greatneſs (more then the Ocean is to a ſingle drop) over thoſe who are but meer Creatures the Work of his hands, hath made righteous Ordinances enforced with ſutable Rewards and Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, notwithſtanding the latter may ſeem hard and grievous to us. Yet how great ſoever they are, miſerable experience ſheweth they are neceſſary to preſerve his Government, and to keep us in Subjection and Obedience.</p>
               <p>In Truth we cannot well ſhew it otherwiſe, then by a reverent Regard and Conformity to his Word. <hi>No Man hath ſeen God at any time,</hi> John 1. 18. Nor doth now hear his Voice. In what manner then ſhall he ſhew himſelf ſubject to this infinite Being? Let him ſhew forth never ſo much will-Worſhip, Humility or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glecting of the Body, think to gratifie with ſomething of his own; (as corrupt Nature is too fond of its own Inventions)<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet if he hath not regard to the preſcribed Pattern, all is eſteemed <hi>as cutting off a Dogs neck,</hi> the Reaſon is added, <hi>Yea they have choſen their own ways.</hi> If he offers up never ſo much, or ſeeks to pleaſe <note place="margin">Iſa. 66. 2, 3.</note> him, that ſignifies nothing, <hi>For all theſe things have been ſaith the Lord: But to this Man will I look, even to him that is of a poor and contrite Spirit, and trembleth at my VVord.</hi> If God ſhould ſhake the Heavens and the Earth, the moſt ſtout Inhabitants here would tremble, and they could not do otherwiſe: But now he ſanctifies the Lord and makes him his dread, who ſhews himſelf awful and pliant at hearing, or reading of his revealed Will. If he did roar from <hi>Mount Zion,</hi> or utter his Voice from the Battlements of Heaven, then the People would preſently cry out after their won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted manner, <hi>All that the Lord hath ſpoken we will do:</hi> But when the noiſe is gone and the fear is over, they would forget that, and return to their own ways. Now it remains written in a Book that it may not be once, but for ever, and there is the ſtill Voice of the Spirit which would ſet it home to our Hearts, and by this way he is pleaſed to try our Obedience. And indeed how can it be better ſhewn forth then by ſincere doing, according to that
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:46484:235"/> which we ſurely believe to be the very mind of God, what he would have us to do.</p>
               <p>Yet alas! What ſtrugling and conteſting is there againſt this? A manifeſt Token of that diſobedience which lies hid in the heart of Man, and puts it ſelf forth by Cavil, Diſtinguiſhing, Evaſion, or ſetting themſelves againſt thoſe who keep cloſe to it. All this proceeds from that Root of Enmity and unwillingneſs to comply therewith. <hi>He that is of God, heareth Gods words,</hi> John 8. 47. <hi>VVhen ye received the word of God, ye received it not as the word of Men, but (as it is in Truth) the word of God which effectually worketh alſo in you that believe,</hi> 1 Theſ. 2. 13. All is but vain and deceitful words, which have not Relation to this Rule, either by neceſſary Conſequence or Connexion.

               <p>Should the Almighty have erected his Throne viſible on Earth, People might be over-awed with the Senſe of his Majeſty and Greatneſs: Or elſe be invited by that Splendour and Glory, to run unto him as now they do to Kings and great Perſonages. So they might, and would yield a feigned Submiſſion and love unto him. <hi>But the Kingdom of God is within you,</hi> Luke 17. 21. He hath eſtabliſhed his Government in the Hearts of Men. The Law he hath given is in a Book which may be read or heard to lay up in the Heart, and do accordingly. Such of the People as ſhall be willing and obedient, will ſhew themſelves this way: and thoſe who refuſe and Rebel, will do ſo likewiſe. Who now live by Faith, and approve their Subjection unto his revealed Will, would do ſo much more if they had a ſight of him, or hear his Voice, as they ſhall have both to their exceeding and endleſs Comfort: But to them, who now will not believe nor hearken <note place="margin">Pſal. 107. 11.</note> to his Word, when he hath made himſelf known after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,

               <p>Paul <hi>as his manner was reaſoned with them out of the Scriptures, opening and alledging that Chriſt muſt needs have ſuffered,</hi> Acts 17. 2, 3. Who is the great Mediator, all that he did and ſaid was to bring people unto God; and ſo ſhould every one do in a point like neceſſary as that was to the unbelieving Jews.

All which have Foundation in the Word, but the phraſe <hi>reaſoned</hi> is obſervable, and always to be imitated in ſubordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to that; The Scriptures do contain general commands and rules of Holy Life, to which thoſe who are <hi>Contentious and obey not the Truth,</hi> Rom. 2. 8. can frame diſtinctions and find out e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſions to deceive and keep quiet their own Souls; but the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular handling and application of them, convinces of ſin and turns to Righteouſneſs. The Holy Ghoſt hath provided for all Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, Countries and Languages, and Penned them after this manner for thoſe who in their ſeveral Places and Ages ſhould be

It is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Office of our underſtanding to collect one thing from another; Whatſoever is rightly inferred from the Word of God, is the Word of God, and will be fulfilled; for nothing but truth can follow from truth. There cannot be uſed too much care and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpection concerning this Ordinance of Preaching to manage it aright, becauſe ſo much depends thereon for the preſent Good and Univerſal Salvation of Mankind, which is to be revealed and determined in a ſhort time; for the World will quickly be at end with us living, and how many Generations more may ſucceed, God knows, but we may underſtand and truſt unto what he ſaith and promiſes, <hi>And they that be wiſe ſhall ſhine as the Brightneſs of the Firmament, and they that turn many to Righteouſneſs, as the Stars for ever and ever.

               <p>When we hear or read the Word, God ſpeakes unto us; but when we make Prayers and Supplications with Thanskgiving, we <note place="margin">Of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</note> ſpeak unto him.

It ſignifies little to ſay with the Mouth according to the common form, if one thinks otherwiſe in the heart, God knows that; or if he doth really Judge, God is to be obeyed and Worſhipped, it is to be ſhewed forth by outward Action.

               <p>By Prayer we acknowledge Gods Authority over us, we confeſs our ſelves Servants, Subjects, and Children that live upon his good Providence, and that all things come from him. We believe on him whom we have not ſeen; We give credit to his gracious promiſes, and ſtand in aw of his threatnings, and thereupon moſt of our Petitions are founded. We are in our proper Office when we lift up our Soul, and our Deſire is unto him. God is moſt pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in actual Obedience, working of Righteouſneſs, and bringing forth fruits of Well-doing; yet by Prayer there is a tendency and inclination in the Soul to them, there is a begging help and willing mind to do according to the power given us, there is an asking forgiveneſs for what we have done amiſs, and to perform better Obedience for the time to come. What can God require more of his poor imperfect Creatures, then to do according to their Ability, and to help out their infirmities by humbly craving a Pardon for them, and ſincere deſires that they were better? He is Faithful and Good, knowing our frailty and condition. <hi>We have an High Prieſt that is touched with the feeling of our Infirmities,</hi> he hath pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed a Salvation and Reward if we do according to them, his Righteouſneſs and perfect Obedience ſupply our defects.</p>

Now the deſirable thing is Heaven and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, but there is no leaping into it without going in the way; for this is Gods immutable decree, and nothing can be granted contrary to that, which is by Obedience and Holineſs, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary is ſin: And therefore we are to beg forgiveneſs of that, and to ask for the Holy Spirit by which we may be enabled to live ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Will of God in all things. Provided, when that prompts to do ſuch a thing, we be ſure to comply with it, and ſo when we have dictates to leave another thing undone; for God will not be ſo put off, that when he inclines towards the doing of his Will and we do it not, but only pray that we may do it. If thy Servant ſhould come from time to time for aid and aſſiſtance to do ſuch a thing for thee, and thou granteſt him his requeſt, yet he never doth that which he pretends he would if he had ſuch help, wouldſt thou not ſay he did mock and ſlight thee? The be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of a thing is a deſire towards it; when that is, then if there is power, it will be certainly done. So that if there is an unfeigned deſire to keep Gods Commandments, this will ſeek out for ſtrength and ability to do ſo; <hi>Ask and it ſhall be given you, ſeek and ye ſhall find, knock and it ſhall be opened unto you,</hi> Mat. 7. 7. The command and promiſe is not given only to Diſciples or choſen Ones, <hi>for every one that asketh receiveth, and he that ſeeketh findeth, and to him that knocketh it ſhall be opened,</hi> verſ. 8. Here Man will fly back again and ſay he cannot ask, But yet he can <hi>ask Bread, Fiſh,</hi> or any good thing of another; and why then will he not ask good things of our Father which is in Heaven? Hath he a real deſire to be ſaved? Why, there is a willingneſs in all Men to this Bleſſed end. But here is the difference between the Fool and Wiſe Man, the firſt would have it without the means, the latter knows it is impoſſible, and therefore muſt have both or neither. Indeed there is an a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The Man is frightened and gives back, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is neceſſary for him to have a true report abſtracted from the lies and falſe Imaginations, to have all the encouragement that can be given, to be urged with the abſolute neceſſity, and that it is an exceeding Good<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> land; all that Men can poſſibly do is little enough to get poſſeſſion there. They do already ſubmit

               <p>In the work of Mans Salvation the Word and Preaching are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Prayer, for how ſhall they pray for what they have not known, or for what they have not heard?

               <p>To imagine God is pleaſed with the bare ſaying of Words, when they are neither minded nor underſtood, it may be more truly thought, that he likes better the Chirping of Birds, then ſuch Service from reaſonable Creatures. There hath been a deal of Chaunting forth of Maſs, and Toning out of Prayers. But how well they have been ſung or ſpoken forth, we muſt have unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Thoughts of the Godhead, if we ſuppoſe him to be deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the meer outward noiſe, or reciting only ſuch Words before him.

They muſt be <hi>Fools who offer ſuch Sacrifice,</hi> or think he will accept of it; for he that gave to Man knowledge, ſhall not he know?

This is not ſo much intended againſt that infirmity of wandring thoughts in Prayer, but when of ſet purpoſe they keep their Heart to themſelves, not giving it to God, but imagine to put him off with ſuch outward Service.

And therefore our Prayers for the Converſion of the Heathen World, or of any one elſe are not likely to be granted, unleſs the like means be uſed towards the Accompliſhment there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. And that may be done by the pure reformed Church, all one as it hath been attempted by corrupt and cruel Popiſh Emiſſaries. If the words of eternal Life be ſimply and ſincerely declared <note place="margin">Pſal. 138. 4.</note> unto them, as the Apoſtles and Primitive Teachers did to us, who were in darkneſs: How know we but <hi>the time of the Promiſe draws nigh,</hi> that the fulneſs of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> may come in? <note place="margin">Acts 7. 17.</note> Let not thoſe whom the Lord ſhall move by his Spirit to this bleſſed Work, be Rebellious unto it; but go forth accordingly. <hi>I am ſought of them, that asked not for me: I am found of them that ſought me not.</hi> Iſa 65. 1. when it is through unavoidable igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,

               <p>God is ſtill Sovereign and a moſt free Giver, he may ſcatter the Mercies of his left hand, or ſuffer thoſe to come at them, who do not ſeek unto him: Yet it is but a ſmall thing to have their portion in this life, though it is preſent and viſible, and the low Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted World eſteems every thing that is ſo; ſtill it is little, for it comes exceeding ſhort of a true Happineſs, which ſignifies little when had, and nothing when it is over, and by being too often abuſed, it tends to the hurt of the owners, bringing upon them a greater condemnation. If all thoſe in paſt Generations, or who have been with us, and are juſt now departed hence, would ſtand up and tell us what avails all the Worldly proſperity they have had: If thoſe who are now in the midſt of it would ſpeak their minds ſincerely, that the days paſt are vaniſht away as nothing, if they would freely declare the Irkſomeneſs and Satiety of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; if they would acknowledge that doubtful Expectation, how it ſhall be with them after theſe things are ended, and they haſte not knowing how ſoon; if all this were conſidered, there is no ſuch Cauſe why they ſhould <hi>ſpeak loftily againſt Heaven,</hi> or ſay in their Hearts, How doth God give them theſe things? They are proud and diſobedient againſt him, who in his Providence either ordered or permitted them to have what they make matter and occaſion of being ſo. But however, becauſe they have theſe things without <note place="margin">Pſal. 140. 8.</note> or with asking, they will ſeek for no more. O that they would know for their Good, as otherwiſe they ſhall be ſenſible to their Coſt and Diſappointment, that there are others they now ſet at naught ten thouſand times more valuable, then thoſe they now ſo boaſt themſelves in.</p>
               <p>Even thoſe the Apoſtle makes mention of, and is thankful for, <hi>Bleſſed be the God and Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who hath bleſſed us with all ſpiritual Bleſſings in heavenly places in Chriſt,</hi> Eph. 1. 3. Which are reſerved to be fully had there, and for ever to remain. It is the greateſt Happineſs here below to have thoſe things, which are in order to the Attainment and making ſure of them: Of which we have ſometimes a little Glimpſe and ſoretaſte, and even they exceed all the Pleaſures of this World. So it is reaſonable to pray earneſtly for the common Salvation, to pour out our Soul in Supplication, and ſet our hands to do accordingly; for Prayer
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:46484:241"/> ſignifies nothing without Endeavour: There muſt be a Begging, Compliance, yea, and working with the Grace of God, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it is received in vain. God doth not beſtow his ſpiritual and eternal Mercies, his Jewels of real Worth and Excellency to thoſe who do not ſeek unto him for them: Who think them not worth asking for, may go without them, and make much of their lying Vanities, which both deceive and ſlip away, leaving the Poſſeſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours in deſpair and miſery; <hi>When the Gift of God is eternal Life,</hi> and he alone is Happy, who both prays and uſes the means to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it.</p>
               <p>The great prejudice that Fleſh and Blood which is dull and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing hath againſt this Ordinance, becauſe it thinks there is no preſent and viſible benefit thereof. Did the Exhalation of our Prayers fall down again in a ſhower of Bleſſings which might be ſeen or had, then more would be offered up, and alſo with dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and earneſtneſs. But now whether we pray for temporal Mercies, or againſt Evils, yet all things happen alike to all, and it may be juſt the very ſame as if none had been. If it is concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <note place="margin">Hab. 1. 2.</note> ſpiritual and future Good and Evil, why theſe are not ſeen, and they may be all but Fancies, and imaginations; or God may no more mind as to them, then he ſeems to do the things before us: So our Prayer may appear to be vain, the ſending forth of words and breath into the Air.</p>
               <p>This mighty Stumbling block doth quite keep off the ungodly Man from making any Prayer at all, for he ſees it is the ſame with him that Sacrifices, and him that Sacrificeth not. Even he doth ſometimes try, and if he finds no preſent Good of it, he leaves off and is confirmed more in ungodlineſs. The ſteps of the good Man do alſo well nigh ſlip: He hath Temptations to deſiſt, and ſome little queſtioning within, whether th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> wonted manner. <hi>Thou that heareſt Prayer,</hi> ſeemeſt as if thou heardeſt it not. A thouſand kind of thoughts may ariſe in our minds: Whereas it is our infirmity and ignorance of the ways of God: It is our Sin and Provocation that makes him ſo far from us, and from hearing the Voice of our Supplication, and moves him to have no more to do with us, unleſs his Goodneſs, Condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Truth, and alſo ſome choſen People did preſerve his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:46484:242"/> and Care over the Inhabitants of the Earth. <hi>So fooliſh was I and ignorant, I was as a Beaſt before thee,</hi> Pſal. 73. 22. I did no more underſtand of the ways of God towards the Children of Men, then thoſe dumb Creatures do apprehend his doings. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides original Blindneſs, Sin caſts a Cloud over the underſtanding, deprives of the knowledge of the things of God, that <hi>ſeeing they may ſee, and yet not perceive,</hi> and <hi>hearing they may hear, and not underſtand,</hi> have a general underſtanding, but not attain to the Divine Senſe of things. <hi>For what Man knoweth the things of Man, ſave the Spirit of Man which is in him? Even ſo the things of God knoweth no Man, but the Spirit of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 2. 11. Even this which hath been the occaſion of ſo much unbelief and falling away, may be clearly underſtood out of the Scriptures, his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed Will. <hi>Seek ye out of the Book of the Lord and read,</hi> Iſa. 34. 16. If Men did according to Duty in their doubts, Difficulties and Temptations reſort to that, this would ſatisfie; but the cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Satan keeps them off, and they would apprehend the things of God, any other way then his Book, by which only they are to be known.</p>
               <p>The Foundation of all Religion is Faith, <hi>The juſt ſhall live by his Faith,</hi> Hab. 2. 4. Whatever he ſees and obſerves abroad he reſolves all upon this Principle, and ſticks firm to that. This is the firſt thing inſiſted upon and required. It is obſervable, though God hath done all things to beget <hi>a more full aſſurance of Faith,</hi> yet there is nothing ſo very evident, as takes off from all manner of doubt, for this would exclude and deſtroy Faith, which is the firſt Decree and Ordinance of God. And therefore he <hi>hides himſelf,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Job 23. 8, 9.</note> and his doings ſo far as to exerciſe that: Notwithſtanding all the Arguments and Demonſtrations that are pretended, we muſt at length reſolve it upon that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Through Faith we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that the Worlds were framed by the word of God,</hi> Heb. 11. 3. We know that God is by natural Reaſon and perfect Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but for things done heretofore, and things to come, there we believe him true who hath ſaid and promiſed, which is the Office of Faith. Let no Man lay any other Foundation, or ſeek to undermine this which God hath laid, for this ſtandeth ſure, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing much more evident and credible to the Hearts of Men, then all thoſe intricate Diſcourſes are to thoſe which underſtand them, but inſignificant to the People, and Difficulties ſtill ariſe to the learned. Reaſon is very ſerviceable in its due place of Subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:46484:242"/> but it rather confounds when it ſets up equal, and would ſeek to overthrow Faith; for this firſt begins all Diſcourſe and inference as to things Divine, for we muſt believe ſome to be fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before we can reaſon from one thing to another. When all is done there muſt be Faith. To maintain and keep this up, all Gods doings may be obſerved to be wiſely ordered. His letting of things go on in a natural and orderly way may exerciſe the belief of a Providence, for ſome may be tempted to aſcribe them unto Time and Chance. That many more of his things are inviſible, ſome may thence incline to doubt of and deny them. But Faith receives them as revealed? And Reaſon will come into aſſiſtance, that it may not be thought incridible; for it is evident there are ſome things which are not ſeen, as a <hi>Sound</hi> or <hi>Smell,</hi> yet theſe are perceived by the <hi>Ear</hi> and <hi>Noſe:</hi> And ſo we have as great a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of them as the things we ſee. God is inviſible, and ſo are the things of this Kingdom, yet they are as evident to our own Souls, as Carnal things are to Bodily Senſes. But ſtill we cannot remove all Difficulty, We muſt at laſt reſort and cleave unto this, <hi>I believe in God and the Revelation, he hath made of himſelf in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi> Men would fain climb up to certain Evidence, then they would ſerve God, and be ſuch as he would have them: But thank you for nothing, this is purely Selfiſh and Mercenary: Thoſe who will not do it by the way God hath preſcribed of Faith and waiting for him, may let it alone, he cares not for their Services. It is ſo eſtabliſhed that Men may believe, and yet room may be left for infidelity; that all may uſe the means to come unto Faith, and yet ſome by too curious and wrong inquiry, others by Care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſsneſs and neglect may be ſtill unbelievers.</p>
               <p>And therefore Scripture ſeems to have Penned Myſterious, and perplex in many Places, that the Tryal of our Faith might be had even as to that, how every Title is true, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>hall be fulfilled, though ſome things may appear next to impoſſible, contrary and falſe by daily Experience. <hi>Have Faith in God, for verily I ſay unto you, that whoſoever ſhall ſay to this Mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou caſt into the Sea, and ſhall not doubt in his Heart, but ſhall believe that thoſe things he ſaith ſhall come to paſs, he ſhall have whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he ſaith. Therefore I ſay unto you, what things ſoever ye deſire, when ye pray believe that ye receive them, and ye ſhall have them,</hi> Mark 11. 22, 23, 24. yet himſelf, who ſaid this, did certainly deſire with Earneſtneſs. <hi>If it be poſſible let this Cup paſs from me.</hi> But him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf

So we may at this preſent time pray for ſomething againſt, or not conſiſtent with the Will of God, and therefore it is not granted. We know the Will of God by what he hath revealed: In theſe laſt days under the Diſpenſation of his Son, there is little ſaid of temporal things. And therefore we have no Promiſe of Gift or deliverance, as to the outward Good or Evil of this preſent time. <hi>Ye ask, and receive not, becauſe ye ask amiſs, that ye may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume it upon your Luſts,</hi> Jam. 4 3. Even what may be occaſion of Sin, Pride, Vanity, Diſ-eſteem or Forgetfulneſs of God; And therefore he in Goodneſs denies it. <hi>And this is the Confidence that we have in him, that if we ask any thing according to his Will he heareth us,</hi> 1 John 5. 14. <hi>Whatſoever we ask we receive of him, becauſe we keep his Commandments, and do thoſe things that are pleaſing in his ſight,</hi> 1 John 3. 22. This Qualification is too often wanting, for ſome make many Prayers and give no Obedience, or an half one with reſerves, and ſo their Petitions are not granted as is implyed from <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. 29. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 59. 2. <hi>Jer.</hi> 29. 13. Again, <hi>The effectual fervent Prayer of the righteous Man availeth much,</hi> Jam. 5. 16. but that doth not which is Lazy and Negligent. And then want of <hi>importunity,</hi> Luke 18. Such Cauſes may be aſſigned out of the Word, why there is not ſo great return to our Prayers as may be expected: And whatever People think the fault is only in themſelves, they have not thoſe neceſſary Qualifications, or do not order their Prayers according to the Rule. Gods word is Truth, but Men do not obey, and are not guided by it. The Promiſe is certain, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 7. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 13. but they do not perform the Conditions; and to excuſe themſelves would imagine there might be falſhood in that which came by Inſpiration from him.</p>

Let none fear, he that doth Gods Will, and uſeth the appointed means ſhall be aſſured of this. That Petition, <hi>Give us our daily Bread,</hi> Chriſt never put in vain, neither is his Promiſe, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 33. come to an utter end. More then this we have no where Licenſe to ask, neither hath God paſſed his word to beſtow. We are apt to grudge at ſuch a ſmall Pittance as we would think it; But do we not believe what is to come?

Nature doth all things ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the common voice of the generality, which proceeds from unbelief or ſullenneſs: Whereas they might know this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture muſt be from ſome one elſe, who makes it to act in ſo regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar and conſtant a way. Nature of it ſelf is blind, and could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver bring forth things in ſuch an exact orderly manner, unleſs directed by the Wiſdom above; It is turned and winded, and whence ſhould this be, but from the firſt mover of all things? The infidels, when they are beaten out of every hold and ſhelter, will run for refuge underground, their laſt reſort is to the workings of Nature; but theſe turn againſt them, and prove contrary to what they would have, ſo they had better now, then be forced to it at the laſt day, to <hi>move out of their holes like Worms of the Earth, they ſhall be afraid of the Lord their God, and fear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of thee,</hi> Mic. 7. 17.

Even hard hearted <hi>Pharoah</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood more then they, for he did not cry out it was the Wind that brought the Locuſts, he knew the hand that ſmote him. <hi>The Lord brought an Eaſt-wind, and the Eaſt-wind brought the Locuſts, and the Lord turned a mighty ſtrong Weſt-wind which turned away the Locuſts,</hi> Exod. 10. 13, 16, 19. He might have magnified and made himſelf more viſible by bringing them a ſtrange way, but he was pleaſed to make uſe of a ſecond cauſe as he doth generally in all his doings towards the Children of Men, whether in ſending Judgment or Mercy; As afterwards in the <hi>Manna</hi> and <hi>Quails,</hi> Pſal. 78. 23, 24, 26, 27. Unleſs a Man is low and ſhort in his reaſoning, he muſt at laſt reduce all to the firſt cauſe of things; <note place="margin">Hoſ. 6. 3.</note> Though one acts by ſubordinate inſtruments, yet ſtill he is at free liberty to act or not act; and again after this or that manner. God hath the diſpoſal of all ſecond cauſes, and what we eſteem acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent is wiſe deſign or permiſſion, which he can either hinder or intend as he pleaſes, ſo his providence is ſtill the ſame. Who brings on evil by its next cauſe, can alſo remove it; He who ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered them, can alſo take away the impediments; as he doth ſhut the Womb, ſo he doth open it; <hi>For the Pillars of the Earth are the Lords, and he hath ſet the World upon them,</hi> 1 Sam. 2. 8. All things are his, and then certainly he can turn and diſpoſe them howſoever he will: Though he hath now appointed things to go on in ſuch a manner, yet he ſits at the Helm and manages the whole courſe of Nature according to his good pleaſure and Sovereignty. But becauſe it goes on moſt commonly in the ſame way there do ariſe doubts, when it is thus wiſely contrived, that all who conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der throughly, muſt believe a Providence for things here below; which again continue as they were from the beginning of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, this exerciſes the belief thereof. We may pray againſt out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward evils, that God would be pleaſed to remove what he doth ſend. <hi>Shall there be evil in a City, and the Lord hath not done it?</hi> Amos 3. 6. <hi>Come let us return to the Lord, he hath torn and he will heal us,</hi> Hoſ. 6. 1. That want of univerſal reformation is many times a cauſe he doth not remove publick or private Calamities; ſometimes he doth, but not preſently to try our faith and truſt in him, when we know the Rod, and who hath appointed it, tho' we ſaw no hand lay it on or will take it off, <hi>Although the Fig-tree
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:46484:244"/> doth not Bloſſom,</hi> Hab. 3. 17. There is no outward appearance of help or means, yet God can furniſh and put in mind of them in due time. As to this our Prayers are often heard and granted, he ſtirs up the heart and affections of Men towards us, makes the Bones that were broken to rejoyce, heals our Diſeaſes and Sores by directing to the uſe of fit Remedies, and firſt putting that ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue in them. All this ſeems to be alike to them, who pray not, which is to be imputed to Gods gracious Nature, to try the Faith of his Children, to manifeſt their unbelief and unthankfulneſs; If they have eſcaped Worldly danger and evil, yet worſe things wait for them, from which they will not be delivered unleſs they both pray and alſo uſe the means to avoid them. But that there is a real and ſenſible difference between the Righteous and the Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as to outward good and evil may be known by this, that the one hath a more ſweet enjoyment and comfort in them both, which no wicked Man hath or can pretend unto. So that as to the preſent time and leſs material things, notwithſtanding what prophane ſinners ſay, or others think, <hi>It is not vain to ſerve God,</hi> Mal. 14. <hi>and they have profit who pray unto him,</hi> Job 21. 15.</p>
               <p>But much more doth it avail to procure inward and Spiritual good, to hinder from temptation and evil; It doth help in things which pertain to preſent Peace and future Happineſs, for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration and joyful expectation to a perfect and conſummate Glory, and to get ſafe from the evils of the other World. Now we come to the Man, which is within: for outward good and evil is light and but for a Moment, the one faintly delights and vaniſhes away, the other vexes a little and will have an end; But what hath relation to Eternal Happineſs and Miſery, What is beg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>n here imperfectly, and will in a little time be fully made manifeſt in a perfect and irreverſible ſtate of one or the other; Here if our moſt fervent and devout Prayers to God will do any ſervice to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the good, and eſcape the evil ſet before us, they muſt be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary and highly important. We have all the aſſurance in the World if any thing which is ſpiritual and inward, is ſomewhat more then fancy and imagination, that theſe things are ſo. As certainly as our Souls are ſomething more then meer Breath, ſo that inward ſence of Religion (which is properly Religion as the other is the Man) is real and ſomething beſides imagination or outward talk. It is certain, the fruits of its Obedience and good works do appear without and are ſeen; but the Root and Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:46484:245"/> is within, <hi>Conſcience towards God:</hi> And again it is evident that many do act only by this Principle contrary to their preſent eaſe and conveniency in the World. The work of Religion is real and the effect thereof, <hi>Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace whoſe mind is ſtayed on thee, becauſe he truſteth in thee,</hi> Iſa. 26. 3. Now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed this cannot be ſo perfectly demonſtrated to the natural ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Man, but the experience is ſo well known to the happy poſſeſſors of it, that they eſteem it before all wordly advantages whatſoever. It is ſo in univerſally good and ſincere People, but then it is ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, fond hopes and expectations will cauſe complacency of Spirit; Whereas herein may be obſerved the difference between the reality of the one and falſhood of the other, for the firſt will bear all Tryal and Examination, and ſtill ſhew forth reaſonable and certain grounds of truſt and confidence, but the other can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do this; he muſt go on in his way, not enduring the touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone; a convincing Argument, the firſt is true, the other falſe and counterfeit.</p>
               <p>Beſides there is a ſenſible growth in Grace and Knowledge, a more confirmed purpoſe of Obedience, a mortification of ſin, an aſſurance of Gods favour and the well grounded hope of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life, That converſation in Heaven and antepaſts of it, that rejoycing and ſtrengthening in the inward Man; All theſe are as truly perceived as others find exultancy in their honour and eſteem in the World, in thoſe vain projects which are doubtful and come to nothing; When there is the promiſe and word of God for the reality of thoſe afore ſpoken of. It is but a ſmall pleaſure which reſults from the graſping and enjoyment of temporal things, but that conceit which goes before, thoſe promiſes of good and the propoſed ſatisfaction whilſt but in purſuit, are equally if not more delightful then when the thing is actually, had and preſent. And yet the firſt is a meer fantaſtick happineſs (as none of this World is much better) which yet is ſenſible and pleaſing. It is an inviſible, but real delight, though it relates to viſible and corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real things: Every ſcheme of ſatisfaction Men raiſe to themſelves in this World, they find the firſt apprehenſion thereof good and pleaſant, which is wholly within. Hereupon they act further, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing themſelves to pain and trouble, and perhaps this is all they will have, for they may be diſappointed at laſt, either by miſſing the thing they aim at, or propoſing to themſelves more contentment then realy it hath. Let the ignorant and brutiſh laugh at inward
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:46484:245"/> good and ſatisfaction, yet the outward deceitful vanities of this World make a ſhew of this, or the Man would not ſeek after them. Even the pleaſures of ſence afford moſt delight to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agination before hand, for when they touch, they are unſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory and inſtantly periſh.</p>
               <p>If the things we ſee, handle or hear, are more eſpecially per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from within, How much more may we conclude of the things that pertain to Gods Kingdom, which are purely Spiritual and Inviſible, which are exactly fitted to the reaſonable Soul, that theſe alſo are moſt real and certain. What the Apoſtle ſaith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 14, 15. is true, but though they may <hi>ſeem fooliſhneſs to him,</hi> yet let him not judge them to be vain or falſe, if the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral man might be ſomewhat recovered out of his State, for by reaſon alone he may judge there is ſomething in what is here treated of.</p>
               <p>God's faithful People are fully ſatisfied in their own Hearts of the truth of theſe things, and may be offended that they are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered for proof, which are ſo very plain and evident to them, but ſome are to be <hi>ſpoken unto as Carnal,</hi> 1 Cor. 3. 1. to lead them on to ſpiritual things. But for the confirmation of the Chriſtians Faith, we may thus manifeſtly conclude; if the firſt fruits are true, then is the lump alſo: If the earneſt and pledge is certain, ſo are the greater things to come: If the Scriptures are fulfilled in the Way, as that is known by experience, they will be ſo in the end: By what God hath already given and done for us, he is faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full that hath promiſed, he makes good his word in this life, and will do ſo in that which is to come; this ſupports in the time of faith and waiting: As the Patriarchs received the promiſes of the <note place="margin">Heb. 11. 13.</note> Meſſias, and did deſire his days, but did not ſee them: So our Fore-fathers ſaw him in the fleſh, we do now in his Grace and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, and have known and heard all thoſe things to be exactly fulfilled of him written in the Book of <hi>Moſes, Prophets</hi> and <hi>Pſalms;</hi> It remains that we who have received of his Grace, expect but a little longer till we ſhall be fully partakers of his Glory, when <hi>we ſhall ever be with the Lord,</hi> 1 Theſ. 4. 17. We now read, hear, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and have earneſt expectation of theſe things; but they ſhall at length be openly revealed, and for ever remain preſent to us. <note place="margin">1 Kings 8. 56.</note> All the mean acts are already done and fulfilled, as they were fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told and promiſed; and therefore we may well believe and be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured, that what God hath begun, brought on ſo far, he will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:46484:246"/> to the utmoſt; <hi>For yet a little while, and he that ſhall come, will come, and will not tarry,</hi> Heb. 10. 37.

As to the things heretofore, ſo further on, Bleſſed are they that believe, for there ſhall be a certain performance of thoſe things which are told concerning the day of recompence, of ſeeing God, and for ever being with him. <hi>Your life is hid with Chriſt in God: when Chriſt who is our life ſhall appear, then ſhall ye al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo appear with him in Glory,</hi> Col. 3. 3, 4. The phraſe of being <hi>hid</hi> is remarkable, for it cannot be made ſo evident to others: However, it is as ſenſible to thoſe who have the life of Jeſus mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted in them, as any inward act of Religion is to thoſe who have the leaſt apprehenſion of it.</p>
               <p>Indeed all the other is but the Shell, for the ſubſtance of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is inward and inviſible; which is as certain and apparent to the mind, as outward things are to the S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

If that may be deceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by fancies and imaginations, ſo may they by deluſions: But whatever is truth approving it ſelf to the underſtanding and rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal part of Man (for this is a diſtinct thing from the fancy) of this there is as much aſſurance as what we either ſee or hear. And ſtill if the Soul is deluded in its proper objects, ſo the outward and ſenſitive faculties are in theirs; and then we may as well ſay our ſelves are but ſhadows and apparitions, the World and all things therein are but a dream and painted ſhew, there is not the leaſt ſubſtance in it, which would be a monſtrous abſurdity and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility. If there is any thing real, Religion is ſo likewiſe: As God is who made all things, and by whom they ſubſiſt; ſo he made us alſo to know, glorifie and obey him, hath given us power to do many things in relation to him, which is our proper and only end; If that which gives life, can give aſſurance; If that is ſatisfied of things of leſſer moment, and grounds a full perſwaſion as to them; much more may we give heed to that full acquieſcence of Spirit it hath as to things divine. As ſure as God hath revealed himſelf to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind in Scripture, and they have a through acknowledgement and abundant conviction within them that it is ſo, if they would not wickedly ſtruggle againſt or ſeek to ſtifle it, which is to do vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and act contrary to the beſt of their knowledge and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, witneſſing for the certainty of theſe things, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervedly
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:46484:246"/> renders liable to Gods Wrath and Indignation. But if they deal ſincerely, and ſeek after God with the beſt powers they have, which they are required to do, and then they ſhall find what will demonſtrate to them beyond all contradiction, that all things indeed are ſo which are ſpoken of in the Word.</p>
               <p>And then to prove that ſincere and devout Prayers are benefici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, would be all one as to labour by argument to evince that the Sun ſhines at mid-day. They perceive thoſe returns, which Strangers and Hypocrites may call folly and Enthuſiaſm: Indeed there are ſome who in a ſtorm of Affliction take ſhelter in the Sanctuary, or out of a ſudden heat and willingneſs to be ſaved run to the Houſe of Prayer: And if they do not preſently find eaſe, or laſting in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations to good afterwards, they are ſtill diſquieted and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in the ſame mind, making an haſty concluſion that it is the ſame thing, whether they make Prayers or not. Perhaps the firſt ſort enquire unto God to be rid of the trouble that lies upon them after they have uſed pleaſures, Company, worldly Means, and try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed every thing beſides for help; and when they will not do, God is the laſt reſort whom before they put of in their proſperity, of ſuch it it is Written, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2. 27, 28. <hi>Judge</hi> 10. 13, 14, 15, 16.</p>
               <p>Let others examine themſelves, whether there be not remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing iniquities which ſeperate between their God and them. Do they turn from every evil way, and come with a firm reſolution to be his Servants? Then they muſt patiently expect his time. It is a common error, and proceeds from being unacquainted with the ways of God, to think that things are done on a ſudden, the Graces of Faith, Truſt, Reſignation, and waiting are to be exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed. There are to be found examples in Scripture of thoſe who did many things, who rejoyced and brought forth fruit for a ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but miſcarried at laſt; for the promiſe is to patient conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance in well doing and perſeverance unto the end. Thoſe ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den fits towards good proceed from a ſelfiſh Principle, and want of due conſideration. They would do all things for themſelves, and nothing for God: they are willing to be happy, but not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his terms, and he diſcerning the ſecrets of their heart, it being not right towards him ſuffers them to go on in their own was, and ſo they either grow weary or turn aſide. Their purpoſes not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing built upon the ſure and laſting foundation of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> ſink and fall upon every Wind of temptation; and having not
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:46484:247"/> throughly conſidered how much they muſt do to be ſaved, and when they find it to be more then they firſt thought, they ſtart back and go no further. They would have the time of labour ſhort, but the reward be given quickly: God will not alter his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings to gratifie any one.</p>
               <p>We muſt live by Faith in this World, all the days of our ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed time we are to wait till our change come. What is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed at preſent, is granted now: according to our Faith ſo it is, and ſo will be as to what ſhall be revealed hereafter; There is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement and ſufficient certainty that our Breath is not ſpent in vain. The Incenſe after it is gone off from the Altar preſently vaniſhes out of ſight, and after thoſe breathings of the Soul are paſſed forth the door of the lips they may ſeem to be loſt and gone, but they aſcend up unto Heaven to the <hi>Vials full of Odours, which are the Prayers of Saints,</hi> Rev. 5. 8.

Look up unto Heaven, and think unto whom ye ſpeak, who dwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth on High and filleth all things, this will ſtir up <hi>Reverence and Godly fear:</hi> With how great awe and ſeriouſneſs do the <hi>Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phims</hi> praiſe him, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6. 3.

Call to mind thy paſt acts of Supplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, how happy it would be for thee if they had been performed in an attentive earneſt manner; let this quicken thee the next time to give heed to the preſent, and uſe diligence for the future, that no opportunity may ſlip from thee without <hi>effectual fervent Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</hi>

And though it may be ten thouſand to one whither this is thy Caſe, yet certainly this is and of us all, that we muſt ere long appear before the Judgment Seat of Chriſt, to receive for the Good or Evil we have done, ſo it is near the ſame thing. Reflect on the gliding Nature of time, and as that paſſeth on, try to make it as it were ſtand ſtill by the moſt intenſe Prayer, and other Good Works; for all other things fail and periſh, when theſe are done in Order to what ſhall endure for ever.

But for what time is improved in the means of Grace and a Life anſwerable to them, it tends unto immortal Glory. There is more then a thouſand years recompence for every mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes Work here on Earth: For what doſt thou come before the moſt High God? Are they not <hi>The things that belong to thy Peace,</hi> of greater Concern then Houſes or Lands? <hi>No Man that warreth, entangleth himſelf with the Affairs of this Life, that he may pleaſe him who hath choſen him to be a Souldier,</hi> 2 Tim. 2. 4. It is not ſaid he doth not meddle at all, but doth not involve, plunge himſelf in, for this is a mighty hindrance to the things of God. There can be no Prayer made unto him whilſt the deſire ſticks here below; and again take it off, and the Man can lift it up to God, his Lot and Portion. And therefore let him drive away all Earthly Cares, or leave them behind when he goes up to Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. If Prayers are offered up in a right manner, they will ſtand in more ſtead then getting an Eſtate and labouring to be Rich. We ſhould take as much Care in them as others do in their propoſed Ends, which quickly come to nothing. The more one is abſtracted from the World and preſent things, he is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter enabled for the Worſhip of God. In private he may ſhut
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:46484:248"/> his Door, endeavouring to keep out all Divertiſements. In publick, look to himſelf, not obſerving others Devotions, and neglect his own: Every Perſon ſhall receive the Reward of his own Labour. What others do, what is that to thee? Mind thy Self.</p>
               <p>The World imagine this to be flat, dull and tedious; they ſpeak as they find, for it is ſo where the Heart is unrenewed and under the Power of any Sin. Who are alienated, and Enemies through wicked Works, it is aukward to draw nigh unto God: It is violent and contrary to lift up their Souls unto a pure and Holy Being. But it is not ſo with them who are cleanſed from all Filthineſs of Fleſh and Spirit, who hate every falſe way, and in ſome meaſure are Holy as he is Holy, and therefore he is ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to their Deſires. Thoſe fervours of Spirit, that Joy of the inward Man, are Riddles and Myſteries to thoſe that paſs by, who have only a little taſte by lip Labour or bodily Service, but not throughly acquainted what true Prayer is. The Morning and Evening oblation are acceptable to the obedient and devout, as their Meat and Drink; yea, more, as the Gratification of the Soul doth exceed that of the Body. It is an exceeding ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to propoſe a right and ſure end to ones ſelf, and then all the mediate Acts towards this yield preſent Comfort, and a bleſſed Expectation. <hi>The great end of mankind is God,</hi> He is worthy of all they can do for him, of their utmoſt endeavour to pleaſe and approve themſelves unto him; <hi>For thou Lord art good and ready to forgive: And plenteous in Mercy unto all them that call upon thee,</hi> Pſal. 86. 5. There is a rejoycing, when we do any thing accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Gods Will, a certain Argument that we were made and ſent here for this purpoſe only. <hi>The Sun rejoyceth as a ſtrong Man to run his Race,</hi> Pſal. 19. 5.

And alſo among others, that they may be brought over to partake of the Goodneſs of the Lord.

Here is yet more matter of Praiſe, and alſo to encourage free Obedience; for to live only for a ſhort time would not be altogether ſo much, though God oweth nothing to his Creatures, and as he brought them out of nothing, ſo he could turn them to nothing again; But he hath given moſt full aſſurance, that we ſhall have and ſee greater things then theſe. <hi>The Bread of God is he which cometh down from Heaven, and giveth Life unto the World,</hi> John 6. 33. That Revelation to mankind by Chriſt Jeſus, all thoſe unſpeakable Mercies contained in him, The means of Grace and hope of Glory, do juſtly require ſuch abundant Exalta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our God, that our Soul and all within us cannot worthily Praiſe him. 'This would take up all our Life-time here, as it will the whole length of Eternity.

He who made, doth now preſerve, govern and diſpoſe of them according to the good Pleaſure of his Will. So we are to acknowledge and offer up thanks for all his Mercies, and wonderful Works towards us: Whether in Relation to Soul or Body, this Life or that to come. It is an imperfection of ours to judge any Mercies to be ſmall, for God gives nothing unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of his Majeſty, but the littleneſs is in our ſelves, his Mercies are fitted to our mean Capacity. Knowledge and Inſtruction are not imparted to Horſe or Mule, neither are we to expect the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of an Angel, for our preſent Condition could not bear it, <hi>According as his Divine Power hath given unto us all things that pertain to Life and Godlineſs,</hi> 2 Pet. 1. 3. Even what belongs to this dying Life and vile Body, yet there is ſuch a neceſſity and Connexion of them in order to greater, that they call for our moſt humble and hearty thanks. That prepares for

But let ſuch know, they may have their good things and Conſolation, and hence paſs to his Judgment Seat, of whom they have been unmindful and ſullen. <hi>Hear ye, and give Ear, be not Proud, for the Lord hath ſpoken, Give Glory to the Lord your God, before he cauſe Darkneſs, and before your Feet

But he hath firſt given unto us, and expects the return of good words to our Maker. Only acknowledge and Confeſs with the mouth what we have received, and have Good-will towards him, and ſpeak out of Things truly as they are. Lord, Who would not Praiſe and magnifie thee? Foraſmuch as among all the Beings of the World, there is none like unto thee, thou art the Maker of all, and they from thee. <hi>Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Honour, and Power, for thou haſt created all things, and for thy Pleaſure they are, and were created,</hi> Rev. 4. 11.</p>

There is the very Image of the Godhead upon our ſelves, and a Capacity to know and Worſhip him, all which give perfect aſſurance that we are related, and the Objects of his Concern.

By that abundant Miſery which is every where, he doth let all the Earth know, that he hath indignation againſt Sin, and this the place thereof. Again on the other hand, By ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the felicity of his Choſen, by that little taſte of Happineſs he gives unto his dutiful Children, He doth thereby aſſure, that he deſigns to bring them unto greater, to encourage here, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward hereafter. Their affliction and trouble doth manifeſt the Sin, even theſe have; <hi>They are chaſtened of the Lord, that they ſhould not be Condemned with the World,</hi> 1 Cor. 11. 32. That libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Proviſion and plenty the Evil and unthankful have, is for Tryal or Retribution; for even theſe do ſome little good. <hi>So that a Man ſhall ſay, Verily there is a reward for the Righteous: Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily he is a God that judgeth in the Earth,</hi> Pſal. 58. 11. <hi>The Lord looketh from Heaven: He beholdeth all the Sons of Men, from the place of his Habitation, he looketh upon all the Inhabitants of the Earth, He faſhioneth their Hearts alike, he conſidereth all their VVorks,</hi> Pſal. 33. 13, 14, 15.

The very reaſon why natural and diſobedient people cannot endure to hear or ſpeak of God is for want of what is here mentioned; and they judge of others by themſelves: But examine your ſelves, is there any torment to ſpeak of what one loves?

It is the whole required of Man to love God with all his Heart, all his Soul, all his Strength, and all his Mind, to love him better then any, yea, all things beſides: As much as he can, and to uſe ſincere endeavours to love him more. The firſt thing to be done before any can come unto that, is to <hi>hate evil,</hi> Pſal. 97. 10. And then we may love the Lord, which gives a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate reliſh of every duty we owe unto him; <hi>O how love I thy Law? it is my Meditation all the Day,</hi> Pſal. 119. 97. <hi>My Meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of him ſhall be ſweet, I will be glad in the Lord,</hi> Pſal. 104. 34. <hi>My Mouth ſhall be ſatisfied with Marrow and Fatneſs, whilſt my tongue praiſeth thee with joyful lips,</hi> Pſal. 63, 5. <hi>Praiſe ye the Lord, for it is good to ſing praiſes unto our God, for it is pleaſant, and praiſe is comely,</hi> Pſal. 147. 1.</p>

               <p>That of 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 28, 29. ſhould not keep people away, for this is a certain Rule, That if one truly repents, and diſcerns the Lords Body, that is, eſteem it more then common Bread and Wine, he can never eat or drink unworthily. A common and ordinary capacity doth not judge of more then he ſees or handles: Indeed there are too many, eſpecially in Country Towns and Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages that are ſunk into groſs Ignorance and Darkneſs as to ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual things; who was in the fault, will be judged at the laſt day: There being throughout our Land <hi>like Prieſt, like People,</hi> both backward and unwilling, the one to give, the other to receive in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. Yet any one that is a Man and reaſonable Creature (otherwiſe he could not do the common buſineſs of life) may conceive thus much, that God is, who made the World and all things therein; The Bible is his Word, and whatſoever is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten therein, is moſt true and certain: When this is heard or read ſincerely, it will by degrees let in more Light into his Soul: E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially if he goes to the place where it is Preached and Expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. He may come to underſtand the ſence and meaning, for the Scripture in neceſſary things is very plain, and then to conceive thereof in his mind. There he may learn that under the old Law God inſtituted many Ceremonies, and required the punctual ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of them; and though the beggarly Elements and carnal Ordinances are done away, for they were Types of Chriſt our Paſſover who is now riſen; yet ſince his ſupper is ordained to be kept in perpetual remembrance, it muſt be by that way and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner himſelf hath preſcribed.</p>
               <p>As Parchment and Wax are little worth of themſelves, but yet uſeful and ſignificative of conveying Land one to another; So our Lord may Miniſter unto us his grace and benefits by the outward ſignes of Bread and Wine; and when they are received in this
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:46484:252"/> Ordinance, they are more to be eſteemed in reſpect of the thing ſignified, then in our common eating and drinking. The Bread broken ſets forth how the body of our Lord was torn upon the Croſs, the Wine poured out puts in mind of his ſide being pierc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and the ſhedding of his blood. <hi>As often as ye eat this Bread and drink this Cup, ye do ſhew the Lords death till he come,</hi> 1 Cor. 11. 26.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The like Figure whereunto even Baptiſm doth alſo now ſave us, not the putting away the filth of the Fleſh, but the anſwer of a good Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence towards God by the reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 1 Pet. 3. 21. That is, not ſo much the ſprinkling or dipping in Water as the thing ſignified. The Apoſtle doth not ſpeak to exclude it, for himſelf uſed it, and ſo did the other Apoſtles who had the Spirit of God, and all the Church down ever ſince. Now there is the ſame prejudice as to that, What doth the meer Water ſignifie? They might have put the ſame queſtion to the Apoſtles themſelves had they been in their time, or to our Lord in the inſtitution of his Supper: There is not ſo much only in the outward ſign, but there is in the thing ſignified.</p>
               <p>Many remain ſtill in Ignorance and Sin, but if they would be ſaved, let them come out from among their Sheep and Oxen, and lift up their eyes to Heaven, conſidering who inhabits there. They muſt not always be confined in a Barn, or with <hi>Saul hide themſelves among the Ruſhes,</hi> or be wholly taken up with the little things of this ſhort life, for they are called out and invited to receive a Kingdom. This is ſpoken in good earneſt: Your only end of coming into this World is to ſerve God, and to know the things pertaining unto him, and hence to be tranſlated up to receive it. If they do that for a while, they will at length perceive there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more in the Ordinances, then what they at preſent imagine through the darkneſs and blindneſs that is in them; None can think ſlightly but who do not underſtand. If they do really believe on Chriſt, it would ſeem no ſtrange thing to come unto his Supper.</p>
               <p>The Man is to raiſe up the higheſt Love for God and his Chriſt, Remember the holy Covenant that hath paſſed between them, with a continued firm ſtedfaſtneſs and ſincere purpoſe to perform the ſame. He may refreſh and ſtrengthen his Faith, eſpecially on the Death of our Lord, and the Truth of his whole Goſpel; he is to

But where he hath notice before hand, and he may lay aſide ſome of his Worldly Buſineſs as this may be done thrice in the Year at leaſt, there let him not approach to this Holy Myſtery without Solemn preparation before, for it is altogether of as high a nature, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves as great reverence as the Paſſover of Old. We are always to have Oyl ready in our Lamps, but then we ſhould trim and make them ready at the meeting of the Bridegroom. It is not an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling or carefulneſs for a day, nor a fit of holineſs for a Seaſon only, for this is the practice of them <hi>Who are Fooliſh, Diſobedient, Deceived, ſerving divers Luſts and Pleaſures,</hi> Tit. 3. 3. who fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly think to make atonement by this Ordinance, not conſidering that ſome will be rejected <hi>who have eaten and drunk in Chriſts pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,</hi> Luke 13. 26. But a due preparation conſiſts in a conſtant courſe of keeping the Commandments of God; There is a build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up in our moſt holy Faith, and a progreſs in the Chriſtian Life, ſo that whoſoever is ſincere and willing as to that, may par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of this Supper to his comfort and benefit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Give not that which is holy unto Dogs,</hi> is the expreſs command of the Maſter of this Feaſt; Since the Church hath been remiſs to this thing, and promiſcuouſly admitted all, the Sacrament is become common and diſeſteemed; When ſhe kept to the rules of our Lord, people were earneſt and deſirous to come, and ſorrowful to be kept away.</p>
               <p>If the Government of God over the World were not in a manner made precarious by thoſe who take upon them the Office and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration thereof, Men would be more willing and obedient under it. Neither would themſelves be ſo <hi>contemptible and baſe among the People,</hi> if they had kept up that authority in word and power which the Lord had given. When a thing ſtoops or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes eaſie, the conſequent is to trample upon and not care for it; they are to anſwer before him, who in their ſeveral Generations have thus managed the cauſe of God. They have not done ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their direction in his Word, for that is <hi>with Authority,</hi> and would if truly Preached, command the moſt Rebellious and Proud hearts of the ſons of Men. God is greater then Men, and
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:46484:253"/> as thoſe who exerciſe Authority, would not ſuffer it to be brought low, neither ſhould his Kingdom and rule over them diminiſh. Truth was once ſtabliſhed in the Earth, the Kingdom of God was once ſet up <hi>with Power;</hi> but now through the treacherous yielding of the ſupporters, it hath been long falling away and loſes ſtrength. God is not the leaſt beholden to his Creatures for ſerving him, as <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. 7. So afterwards his Commandments are given in a <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtick</hi> and <hi>Authoritative</hi> manner, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. And though the ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born Sinner ſaith in his heart, which he Manifeſts in practiſe, I will do this and that juſt contrary; yet he ſhall be anſwered again in Plagues and Puniſhment. In like manner did the Lord Jeſus give out his Commiſſion of Teaching; <hi>Go ye into all the World, and Preach the Goſpel to every Creature: He that believeth and is Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, ſhall be ſaved; but he that believeth not, ſhall be damned,</hi> Mark 16. 15, 16. If People do their duty, it is accepted; if not, they are to expect the danger: There hath been a wonderful deal of begging, yea, moreover civil Authority muſt be called in for aid to bring Mankind over to the ordinances of their God, and all will not do. <hi>When their fear towards him is taught by the precept of Men,</hi> they may come to perform ſuch a Worſhip as is deſcribed in the foregoing part of the verſe, of <hi>drawing near with their Mouth, and honouring with their lips, but have removed their heart far from me,</hi> Iſa. 29. 13. and that cannot be hindred by all legal conſtitutions. What Glory is it unto him to have a meer outward and feigned ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion? If all things were done only according to direction in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, if there was ſound Preaching which maketh not aſhamed, we ſhould ſee other effects of it, even in this degeneracy and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of Times. Notwithſtanding the conceit of Humane <note n="*" place="margin">Iſa. 29. 14.</note> Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in oppoſition to the Divine, yet thoſe ways which are only of Gods ordaining are much better for carrying on his Work and Glory, then the pretended helps Man fancies of his own invention. Thoſe who are concerned herewith, may know what they have to do, and remember that Judgment Seat of Chriſt they muſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear before; they are going out of the World, as their prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors already are.</p>

Every one may ſincerely ſtrive for his part and to the utmoſt, and then the whole will be done: As it may by reducing the Ordinances of God to their right uſe, purging out the Old leaven, and taking away that corruption which hath been ſo long in them. In our good un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings, <hi>God ſhall bleſs us, and all the ends of the Earth ſhall ſear him,</hi> Pſal. 67. 7. By the help given and that is further offered us, by the way ſhewed we might do great things if we would ſhake off unwillingneſs and Sloth. Then labour and be diligent, and the Bleſſed Work would begin; Things may be brought to ſuch a paſs, that <hi>all ſhall know the Lord from the leaſt of them unto the greateſt of them,</hi> Jer. 31. 34.

But that ſtubbornneſs and diſobedience in the heart, their ſinning which they would excuſe and make atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for by this way, did juſtly make God angry, and to abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate their Hypocriſie. When the outward duties (as it is with ſome) do make up the whole of their Religion; Who know not or do not practice any thing more then going to Church, hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sermons, uſing Prayer, receiving the Sacrament; all this is but vain, and will ſignifie nothing; for theſe are means of Grace and in order to ſomething more. Now it would be ſtrange (though common with many) <hi>to be hearers of the VVord and not doers of it deceiving their own ſelves,</hi> Jam. 1. 22. So is Praying to comply with Gods Will, and yet not endeavouring to do ſo; or to Remember the Covenant in Baptiſm, and yet not obſerve it, or only with ſlight purpoſes and reſolution at that preſent time, when the words thereof are to <hi>Obediently keep Gods Holy VVill and Commandments, and walk in the ſame all the days of our Life.</hi> It is mocking and diſſimulation with God if they do not ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely labour after, what they ſeem unto him with their lips and outward geſture to deſire.</p>
               <p>Indeed the Ordinances are part of the Commandments of God; we uſe them out of Obedience and Homage unto him; He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands to hear his Will, to call on Him, and to receive his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments; but then there is a further reaſon of all, to <hi>make rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy a People prepared for the Lord.</hi> It can hardly be expreſſed how averſe our Nature is God and the things of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, how hard it is to cleave unto him as he requires, and how eaſie it is to fall away and ſtart aſide. <hi>Only take heed to thy ſelf and keep thy Soul diligently, leſt thou forget the things which thine eyes have ſeen. Take heed unto your ſelves leſt ye forget the Covenant of the Lord your God,</hi> Deut. 4. 9. 23. The outward duties put in mind of this, and are to be retained all the days of our life, for whilſt we are here in the body, Temptations from without and Corruption from within would betray us into ſin and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfulneſs, unleſs prevented by that Grace which is conveyed through theſe means. Our goodneſs would be as the morning Dew, or as an early Cloud ſo ſoon paſſeth it away, we ſhould ſoon become Barren and Unfruitful, unleſs God was pleaſed to

Otherwiſe the manifold Sollicitations and Objects of this World would be apt to ſcorch and make us fade even in our good Ways, but that received in, renders the Vineyard meet for our God. If his Word falls upon the <hi>duſt of the VVilderneſs,</hi> or Stony and dry places, it may ſeem loſt and ineffectual, not for want of Worth and Excellency in it ſelf, for it is the ſame Rain there; but the incapacity is in the ſubject which doth not profit, becauſe it is <hi>not mixed with Faith in them that hear it,</hi> or they ſuffer it to run off again as uſeleſs Water.</p>
               <p>But if it takes Root, there ſucceed thoſe accompliſhments of the inward Man, and there ſpring up the Fruits of the Spirit. That the Soul may be renewed according to its firſt Creation from whence it was fallen; But now it is to be reſtored to the likeneſs of God, and become partaker of the Divine Nature, The old corruption may be in a great meaſure taken away or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued, the ſeeds of good may be cheriſhed and grow up into acts and habits of doing well.</p>
               <p>Were Men aſſured the things of God were for their Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, they would be for them; they are indeed called <hi>the things that belong to our Peace,</hi> but that is hereafter; they make a promiſe of ſafety, when no danger is ſeen; but now they ſeem to trouble and diſquiet.</p>

               <p>In ſhort, Good is Happineſs, and Sin is Miſery; the more a Man hath of the one, and leſs of the other, ſo he hath the bleſſed Effects, and is freed from Vexation. <hi>Whoſoever is born of God doth not commit Sin, for his ſeed remaineth in him, and he cannot Sin becauſe he is born of God,</hi> 1 John 3. 9. And then he hath not diſturbance nor Reſtleſsneſs of mind, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is he in danger of the Puniſhment to come.</p>
               <p>In Truth, we do many times diſquiet our ſelves in vain, being vexed for, and deſiring we know not what: But this proceeds from the evil of <hi>Ignorance,</hi> a want of underſtanding the Nature of things, which would take away all this Miſery. A right un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding puts upon diligence and endeavour to provide our ſelves, ſo as to keep off the Evil and obtain the Good ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us. And we are not perplexed with thoſe common things, which either do not at all, or not much concern us. What <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>In much Wiſdom is much Grief, and he that increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth knowledge, increaſeth Sorrow,</hi> Eccleſ. 1. 8. That is, When it is only confined to the things before us, and of this Life, for then it quickens the Reſentment of Miſeries here, and finds out no Remedy: But if extended further, as the Excellency of the
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:46484:256"/> knowledge of Jeſus Chriſt our Lord doth, there it mitigates the Vanity and Vexation of the preſent by hope of better things hereafter; ſatisfies of our imperfect State, in order to being made Perfect; and prompts to the doing of all things, to make that ſure unto our ſelves. A little ſmattering of knowledge makes more miſerable, but if throughly improved and ſtretched out to its due pitch of Goſpel Revelation, the ſucceeding Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and as it enters within the Vail, there it is a neceſſary help, and if throughly complyed withal, it will ſecure us of the bleſſed End.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The firſt Man is of the Earth Earthly, the ſecond Man is the Lord from Heaven. As is the Earthly, ſuch are they alſo that are Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy: and as is the Heavenly, ſuch are they alſo that are Heavenly,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 47, 48. As Man was made in the image of God, which was chiefly in Holineſs and good upon his Soul, from which he by Tranſgreſſion fell; So when he is born again, he is tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed into the Likeneſs of his Creator. Whilſt on Earth he aſcends as it were into Heaven, the place of perfect Felicity, as this is an intermixture and imperfection of both, that below is of deplorable and abſolute Miſery. The utmoſt Happineſs which only ariſes from the things here, makes the Soul cleave unto the Ground, and at laſt ſinks into the loweſt Hell; but the true, as it came down, aſcends again; Like Stocks planted by our Heavenly Father, which are grafted and ſhoot forth into Trees of Immortality. What is begun here, God is pleaſed to add, that it may grow, till it reaches above the Clouds, and is perfected in the Regions of Bliſs. The one is <hi>Earthly, Senſual</hi> and <hi>Devilliſh</hi> expreſſed in its three Degrees of ſinking, till it comes to the loweſt. <hi>But the VViſdom that is from above is firſt pure, then Peaceable, Gentle and eaſie to be intreated, full of Mercy and good Fruits without Partiality, and without Hypocriſie. And the Fruit of Righteouſneſs is ſown in Peace, of them that make Peace,</hi> Jam. 3. 15, 17, 18. In the time of imperfection here, we begin to lay a Foundation, which will be builded on, and made con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummate in the Heavens. <hi>Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which is in Heaven is perfect,</hi> Mat. 5. 48. <hi>As he which hath called you is holy, ſo be ye holy in all manner of Converſation,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 15. <hi>And every Man that hath his hope in him, purifieth himſelf as he is pure,</hi> 1 John 3. 3. We are ſincerely according to the
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:46484:256"/> Grace and Power given us, to imitate him in all his Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable Attributes and Excellencies. All our Happineſs ſhould tend upwards, or otherwiſe it is a vain ſhew and deceit; for aſſuredly as we hope that we might be Partakers of his Holineſs, ſo we muſt expect to be Happy, as he is Happy. It was an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Act of the Old <hi>Heathens</hi> (to the ſhame of Chriſtians, who ſeek for boaſting) in taking upon them the Name of <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers,</hi> that is Lovers of Wiſdom, for they ſaid truly, none but God ſhould be called Wiſe: So he is ſtiled <hi>Only VViſe,</hi> Rom. 16. 27. Our Saviour checked one for calling him <hi>Good</hi> upon the ſame Reaſon. In like manner none ſhould be called <hi>Happy</hi> (which is the Comprehenſion of all) but we are in the way, and do endeavour after Happineſs only; And when we ſhall come there, we muſt with the <hi>four and twenty Elders fall on our Faces to aſcribe Greatneſs and Bleſſedneſs unto our God only;</hi> for he hath created all things, and of him are all things, and they do but par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of his Fulneſs, and all they have is from him.</p>
               <p>But hold we are now in the way, and therefore are to be more careful about this, then what ſhall be at the End. We ſhould know, and do what helps toward this perfect Happineſs. The Goodneſs of a thing lies in its right Temper and Equali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; Health of Body conſiſts in a due Circulation of the Blood, in the even and uſual Proportion of moiſt and dry, hot and cold. So there is Peace in the Soul, when the underſtanding doth its Office, the Deſires and Paſſions keep ſtill in their juſt place, and each doth what he ſhould do: For if they do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing all, (as it is the wretched Condition of many? Whoſe Soul as it were ſleeps in the Body, juſt keeping Life and Senſe, who in Lazineſs and Sloth do rather ſnort then live out their days) this deceives into Miſery. It hath a ſhew of Peace, but it is Stupidity, deſcends into the lower parts, and utterly hinders from coming up to Heaven. And this (though it makes no ſuch great noiſe) is the Deſtruction of the World; their refuſing to exerciſe that Ability God hath given them, either by not uſing the powers of the Soul, or not doing it to the utmoſt on its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and excellent End. <hi>VVherefore is a price put into the hands of a Fool, and he hath no heart to get Wiſdom?</hi> Let the latter ſort conſider this Command of our Lord, <hi>ſtrive to enter in at the ſtreight Gate, for many, I ſay, will ſeek to enter in, and ſhall not be able,</hi>
                  <pb n="496" facs="tcp:46484:257"/> Luke 13. 24. Do but really endeavour according to what thou canſt; for not thoſe who <hi>Strive,</hi> but <hi>Seek,</hi> that is in a careleſs and negligent manner, who miſs thereof. We being now in the way to the Reſt that remaineth for the People of God, muſt go on and be travelling; or we ſhall never come to it. Again, all things ſucceed well when they keep within their own Station and bounds, and move according to their ſeveral kinds; more then this is Confuſion and Diſorder, I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>In the things Commanded us, ſome may ſeem to thwart our Nature, yet only as it is corrupted; but they are not contrary to it, when conſidered in its Original purity. If any thing ſeems harſh and i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

It is reaſonable to undergo a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle trouble or inconvenience in order to a greater Good; that alſo is in our ſelves, for we ſinned with our Father, and have ſince added freſh Provocation to his Diſobedience. Now the Law is ordained to help and retrieve the Condition of poor Man, that he may <hi>come to himſelf,</hi> Luke 15. 17. take Care that he do not ſink below himſelf, to bring him into his due poſture, and then to raiſe him yet higher.

                  <hi>The End of the Commandment is Charity, out of a pure Heart, and of a Good Conſtience, and Faith unfeigned,</hi> 1 Tim. 1. 5. Love to God and Men, a right inward Diſpoſition of the Soul is the whole required of us. There are indeed ſome things given to prove our Love; Obedience and Faith; Of this ſort are the Precepts of Self denial, Taking up the Croſs, hating Father and Mother, ſubjecting our ſelves unto Perſecution, rather then offend God. This exerciſes Faith and Love in a high Degree, becauſe we endure real, preſent and viſible inconveniences, only out of Reſpect to him that is inviſible, for future, but certain Rewards. Even now he gives Grace and Strength to bear, hereby aſſuring he will give Glory and Recompence hereafter.
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:46484:257"/> God doth by inward Conſolation or outward Help, arm his Servants againſt all Sufferings. There are none of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments (though they may ſeem auſtere to the ignorant and diſobedient) but tend to the Happineſs of thoſe, who do thereafter. God is good to all who believe, wait and truſt in him. But theſe are extraordinary Precepts, which are (as <hi>Abrahams</hi> offering up his Son) that the Tryal of us might be more perfectly had, to which particular choſen Ones are called out. They happen only at ſome Seaſons according as his Gracious (for ſo I will call it here) Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence is pleaſed to Order. Perſecution, Reproach, Loſſes are not all the days of our Life, theſe are ſhortened for the Elects ſake. <hi>For the Rod of the wicked ſhall not Reſt upon the lot of the Righteous, leſt the Righteous put forth their hands unto ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,</hi> Pſal. 125. 3. they alſo are but Fleſh. There is a <hi>taking up the Croſs daily,</hi> Luke 9. 23. but that may be underſtood of a Preparation againſt it, or a ſuffering in leſſer inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies; Yet ſtill it is ſo ordered by the Goodneſs of God, that his Servants may paſs the greater part of their time in Reſt and Quietneſs. If they have Evil returned for Good, this doth not ariſe from the Commandments of God, but from the iniquity and perverſeneſs of Men. Thoſe are good and reaſonable, but the inconvenience Springs from the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Perſecution ariſes from hence, for it is not through <hi>fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing of good only,</hi> if they keep that to themſelves: The wicked may hereupon conceive ſecret Rancour and Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, yet this doth not commonly break forth into open violence. But then for the other part when they come to meddle with the People, to tell them of their Tranſgreſſions, and ſeek to reform them, this was the unwelcome Meſſage that ſtirred them up to Hatred and Cruelty. Now conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the thing abſtractedly, a King ſends a Meſſenger to his Subjects, to acquaint them of the Violation of his Laws, He would have them make acknowledgment and do ſo no more, then they ſhall have Protection and Peace, otherwiſe they ſhall be deſtroyed. As God is greater then Man, Why ſhould he be hardly thought of, for keeping up his Government over
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:46484:258"/> the work of his hand? Wherein is his Meſſenger to be bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med? What fault is he in for doing only what he is Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to do?</p>
               <p>It is ſecretly conceived, that Religion is prejudicial to the Happineſs of mankind, in that it is the diſturber of Society, and an hindrance to the Peaceableneſs thereof. This med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling vexing Humour ſpoils all: What Reproof is to private Perſons, that is faithful Preaching to the publick; They fancy, it ſerves only to terrifie and diſquiet Men. But as all Government and Community is founded on Religion, the difference of Good and Evil, right and wrong: Theſe would be meer Words only if not attended with Rewards and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments; And theſe would not reſtrain neither, if not for God and the Conſcience of Men, as alſo their Concern of a ſucceeding Eternity, for otherwiſe Rapine and Injuſtice, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content and wearineſs of Life would Attempt ſtrange things. And therefore the Wiſe Politicians and ungodly Men of the World would juſt have ſo much Religion, as to prevent this and no more. But what unworthy thoughts have ſuch Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Almighty God, that his Service muſt be brought down only to their purpoſes, his Kingdom and Dominion over Men, muſt come under theirs, whereas it is now in its due place of Subordination unto that of God. How do a ſmall number of Graſhoppers here in the Earth think of, and would do towards the Great Lord of the World? How do Men that ſhall die and muſt appear before him in Judgment, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mean themſelves towards him, now they are but a little while in the way? It is ſtrange, there ſhould be any ſuch Pride or Rebellion of Heart in <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> yet there is more here as may be perceived by the wicked Talk of ſome, then in the Nations which have not known God. To ſilence the Blaſphemy of theſe, and to allay the thoughts of Heart: Conſider, That <hi>all ungodly Deeds, and all hard Speeches againſt</hi>

Let them reflect, who it muſt be that made the World and all things therein, and then ſpeak lightly of him if they can; Let them obſerve that great Order which is in every part thereof, and then they can never conclude him to be a diſturber of Affairs here below. 'Tis only the abuſe
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:46484:258"/> and non complyance with Religion that is the diſturber of the World. Thoſe who <hi>do violence to the Law,</hi> Zeph. 3. 4. <hi>and pervert the Goſpel,</hi> Gal. 1. 7. Bring in confuſion and every evil work. There is an inclination in the Nature of Man to accept of Gods terms, <hi>to ariſe and be ſaved;</hi> and he not giving way throughly unto that, is vexed and troubled. 'Tis Hypocrites, Partial Chriſtians, and thoſe convictions of wicked ungodly Men, not knowing what to do, which is the <hi>Diſturbance</hi> of the Inhabitants of the Earth. <hi>Let God be true, and every Man a Lyar;</hi> ſurmiſe what we will, all the evil is from our ſelves, but we have that abominable diſingenuous way of taking it off from our ſelves, and would with our Fore-fathers impute it ſomewhere elſe, by this owning we are the Children of him and partakers of his Corruption. Whom would we plead <note place="margin">Gen. 3. 12.</note> with, or excuſe our ſelves before? Are we not to ſupplicate to God for his Mercy? And is this the way by falſe unjuſt inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuations to provoke him yet more? At laſt theſe things will be diſcerned plainly, as they may be at preſent known out of that Book by which all are to be judged; <hi>Righteous art thou O Lord, and true are thy Judgments;</hi> they are ordained to give <hi>Peace on Earth, and good-will towards Men.</hi> If it happens contrary, it is becauſe horribly abuſed or not obſerved: It tends to the Happineſs and benefit of Society, for what doth more then thoſe Duties of Love, Juſtice and Merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs as they are ſtrictly enjoyned by the Son of God? What can be more endearing then to ſtrive together, and help one another forward to the common Salvation?</p>
               <p>In the natural body each part is joyned and doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon the whole, and the good of this again upon the good and order of each part; ſo in the Soul as to things inviſible (but to her ſenſible) there is an happy connexion of them. One tends to the good of her in this Capacity, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to that according to its ſeveral workings, and all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for the benefit of the whole.

               <argument>
                  <p>Of WISDOM and PRUDENCE.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>I need not ſpend many words to ſhew that Wiſdom tends to the Happineſs of Mankind, for this is acknowledged; but the enquiry will be, Whether Religion be this true Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom or not: and if this can be made to appear to them, who know not much more then the talk and rumour thereof. For there are ſome who think all is but prate, and that things hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen at all peradventure; and therefore are for catching what good they can, and bear the evil when it comes, for there is no remedy. But none reaſons after this manner as to the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and what are eſteemed Accidents of this Life. It is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that things are and may be obtained by prudent care and foreſight, and by a wiſe management: So the miſcarriages we fall into might have been avoided, if we had done ſuch and ſuch things. All Tranſactions and Affairs, whether of greater or ſmaller moment, depend upon ſore going means. It is the Office of Wiſdom to make choice of the right and beſt; and of Prudence to make diligent uſe of them accordingly. He that diſcerns not thus much is a Fool and knows nothing, and to go about to convince ſuch an one with Arguments, is what <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>To bray a Fool in a Morter amongſt What with a Peſtil, yet will not his fooliſhneſs depart from him,</hi> Prov. 27. 22. <hi>The fear of the Lord is the beginning of Knowledge, but Fools deſpiſe Wiſdom and Inſtruction,</hi> Prov. 1. 7. Theſe alſo are in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect term called Fools; for notwithſtanding their own ſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, they might thus apprehend, that there is yet more to be known and put in mind of, as there was before they had learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and gathered what they now ſeem to know. None will own openly (though ſome may be found not to follow it) that there is no need of good counſel, and circumſpect action as to the things of this World. Many confine it all here, but think Wiſdom avails not to any thing beyond. In a Chriſtian Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="546" facs="tcp:46484:260"/> few will proclaim their Unbelief, yet the ſecret imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Thouſands are to this purpoſe. That Religion is a reſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Such is the reaſoning in their minds when it is half way, but ſtretch it up higher, and it will dictate thus much. There is not one thing under the Sun, wherein Reaſon is not neceſſary one way or another, and will, if made uſe of throughly, find help. But firſt of all, it leads out of this labyrinth and perplexity of things here below, and looks up unto God who made all things, and hath eſtabliſhed a courſe of things. <hi>Who giveth graſs to the Eater, and miniſtreth ſeed to the So<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

To whom he hath given skill to improve nature, that ſhe ſhall bring forth her increaſe more abundantly. Thoſe which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not Spin nor Sow, have Food and Raiment without; but Man who knoweth both, muſt be Naked and Famiſh if he doth not; ſo the Wiſdom God hath endued him withall, continues his Life: ſee <hi>Iſa.</hi> 28. 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29. And then he being in a frail Body, what inſtinct is to brutes, that is reaſon to him (if he would act according to the beſt of it) to preſerve from Sickneſs, and outward evil Accidents. When they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall, there his underſtanding would do ſomewhat towards re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, by looking unto and removing the cauſe of diſorder: and after all, that which is weak and mortal muſt ſicken and die. The Body is purely natural; we neither made, ſo we do not preſerve it, which breaths and moves when we neither know, nor conſider, nor take care; but increaſes and decreaſes of it ſelf, yet (under the Protector above) a right underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing helps towards the well-being of that during the time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed. If it doth to this which is ſubject to nature and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, that it cannot always relieve; much more would it as to that part of us which is both free and immortal, God having made it ſo, which hath knowledge of good and evil given un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her, and alſo power to embrace the one and flie from the other. The Body forgets what is paſt, being only for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and knows not what is to come; but the Soul remembers
<pb n="547" facs="tcp:46484:260"/> the things that have been, caſts a tranſitory glance on the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and knows the things afar of which pertain to her. She believes him faithful who hath promiſed, and true who hath fore-warned. The Prophets in old time were called <hi>Seers;</hi> for having their Knowledge from God of what was to come, they ſaw it, as if then actually before their Eyes. And we have as great certainty of the things to come, as they had of their particular Meſſages. This one capacity of knowing before hand, would render mankind ſafe and ſecure, if they would give way and act according to it.</p>
               <p>It is evident, that the things before us are temporal and do paſs away: It is a folly to fix up a reſt where we do not continue, a meer deceit and diſappointment to place Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs in what doth not ſatisfie. It is reaſonable to take care a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the things eternal, and where we are to live for ever; as we make a great ſtir to have ſomewhat a longer and better Paſſage through this World. This Life will as certainly have an end as it did begin; and therefore, thought ſhould be taken about that which will follow and always endure, as concerning that now which draws on towards its end. By Faith and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration the inviſible and future things of the other World are ſeen, and alſo preſent; then the Man acts to them, as to the things before us. By what hath been already fulfilled, and now is, he concludes that it ſhall ſtill be; by what is evident and certain already, he may prepare for thoſe things which are no otherwiſe uncertain then as to come, and in another place. He muſt be ſo great a Fool, that one would think a reaſonable Creature cannot be, who believes the Goſpel and conſiders, and yet doth not live accordingly. To do both is not in the power of any, and therefore the laſt is neglected. But can they judge any evil the leſs, which happens upon them through their own inconſideration? Is not this a ſtinging aggravation thereof, and ſo will be much more when there is no poſſibility of redreſs, as ſuch are the concerns of Eternity. The Ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and Sinner expoſe themſelves to a real and intolerable dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, without any hope or deſign, having no ſecurity or preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vative againſt it.</p>
               <p>There are many wiſe conſiderations which move people when they are afar off, to come unto God; but when they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach ſomewhat nearer in his Word, there is ſuch power and
<pb n="548" facs="tcp:46484:261"/> demonſtration of the Spirit, that the obſtinate cannot gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay. The firſt makes to be Religious in general, to be <hi>almoſt a Chriſtian;</hi> The laſt doth it particularly and altogether: And hence Satan who deceives every way, will ſuffer Men thus far; but tryes to keep off from the Scriptures, which are able to make wiſe unto Salvation. The firſt may bring to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Worſhip of God, a moral Converſation, but all upon ſelfiſh Principles; the laſt raiſes that excellent foundation of Faith and Love, teaches to Worſhip in Spirit and Truth, ends in all Obedience and good Works. Let them be advertiſed, that whoſe Religion is built only upon Prudential motives, though this is a good preparatory to go further, yet they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone are not ſufficient to Salvation, for without Faith it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to pleaſe God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 6. it muſt be done in order to him; and not meerly out of reſpect had to ones ſafety, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding for the uncertainty. And how can it be expected, God ſhould reward Men for that which they do with no intention to him? They ſerve God in a careleſs indifferent way, juſt to ſave their own Souls, and no more. They do ſuch things out of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to themſelves, and not out of Love and Duty to God. Their Principle is Wiſe Caution, but not Faith. The miſtake is, they reſt in that, and do not come up to the other; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as true diſcretion would bring them on to thoſe means of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining and confirming Faith, if they would ſtill act purſuant to it. This ſuggeſts not to labour in vain, not lightly to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour, but ſurely to get the thing we aim at, when it may be certainly had by giving all diligence to make our Calling and Election ſure. He that goes but half way will no more come to his Journeys end, then he who doth not move one ſtep towards it; when he hath gone ſo far, Reaſon prompts to go on throughly, becauſe there is ſo much behind, and a little more will ſet him at the deſired end. What did induce to begin, doth urge to preſs forwards ſtill, and to uſe thoſe further helps which are neceſſary towards it. He is an unthinking Fool who is regardleſs of his own Happineſs or Miſery, eſpecially when a ſlight appearance of the firſt, and not enduring to be interrupted, makes him willing to be thus; but as he loves his own pleaſure or eaſe, let him endeavour to preſerve it ſtill, by taking care againſt this ſhall fail what will be hereafter. Every Soul muſt go into Heaven or Hell, there is no avoiding of it:
<pb n="549" facs="tcp:46484:261"/> We are invited to the firſt with Intreaties, Solicitations, graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Methods, and all good ways. <hi>God would have all Men to be ſaved,</hi> ſo there is a willingneſs in them to be ſaved likewiſe. But the difference is, He would have it only in the way of Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and Holineſs; they are for any other then that, or not going, or not continuing therein ſo much as they ſhould. Now when it is taking care for themſelves, or a fear of the Wrath to come, they imagine leſs will preſerve from that; an indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent outward Converſation and not open Ungodlineſs, or ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinence from ſuch ſcandalous Sins will ſet them ſafe as to all. But had they a true love for God, they would think nothing they could do too much for him. The other thoughts will be quieted by Deceits and falſe Preſumption. But further, when a Man ſees a good ſet before him to be had at ſuch a time, there he goes on contentedly, with ſuch a courſe of action and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour, as he knows before-hand is neceſſary to obtain it. Neither is he impatient if not had ſooner, for he knew before it would not be until then. The recompence of reward is much more valuable then all thoſe little ends Men propoſe to themſelves here, and will abundantly anſwer for all ſeeming diſadvantages it hath over preſent things. But it is reſerved in another World; we muſt in a ſhort time go out of this, and in the mean while uſe thoſe means which God who hath promiſed it in his Word, hath there taught as neceſſary to be partaker of it. What our Saviour adviſes of a King making War, ſo we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider of the terms on which we are to enter into Gods Service; only Grace here, and Glory hereafter; neceſſary accommodations for our Pilgrimage, but the true reſt to come; of which we have this aſſurance we muſt depart from this we are now in, and he is as good as his word in what things he promiſed as to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent: And therefore we may truſt further on.

               <p>It is one prejudice againſt Religion, that Men may do much therein; and yet all do not come to Heaven, that propoſe this to themſelves.

<pb n="553" facs="tcp:46484:263"/> mind, that it might go off, and ſeem only as an ordinary Diſtemper or Irregularity in both. There hath been obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved a manifeſt diverſity between the Prophecyings and Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of God, the Illuſions and lying Wonders of Satan. The difference of things is very nice and critical, which ſhould be curiouſly and ſtrictly examined; and this would be as much to the confirmation of Faith, as a ſlight view doth unſettle it. Obſerve further between what things are in themſelves, and what they appear to others: According to the capacity and underſtanding of the Judgers, they are thought true or falſe, whereas the nature of them is ſtill the ſame in it ſelf. Many things, which are the effect of natural Wit, Art and Inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, paſs with the ignorant ſort for Conjuring. What doth exceed common apprehenſion, may ſeem, yea and be called by them Madneſs. Or if they can a little conceive of its Worth and Excellency, then the ſpirit of envy may find fault and miſname it, becauſe of the conſciouſneſs of the want thereof. The Heathen <hi>Feſtus</hi> cryes out, <hi>Paul thou art beſides thy ſelf, much Learning doth make thee Mad,</hi> Acts 26. 24. He ſpoke at a venture, he did not know what to think, when <hi>Agrippa</hi> who had ſome knowledge (though he would not utter it in his vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation) did imagine otherwiſe; he was better then ſome now who profeſs to believe the ſame things, and yet would have ſeconded <hi>Feſtus</hi> his Imputation for the latter Reaſon. In the matter of Religion (which makes ſuch a ſtir in the World, where it is not underſtood, nor univerſally complyed withall) the great Object thereof is <hi>Spiritual and Divine things.</hi> The carnal earthly Man doth not know what that means, he may look upon it as the talk of thoſe in Bedlam, Spiritual and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, What is that? Whereas if he hath common ſence, and is exalted above the Beaſts, He may conceive thus much. What is that Reaſon which is within him? May it be felt or ſeen, and is it not only to be underſtood? That diſcourſe and inferring one thing from another, thoſe pure acts of the mind may give him light and glimmering, that there are other things of the ſame nature. By this he may conſider of <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 20. and then he may come to judge of all divine Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The future things are ſaid to be within the Vail, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot be ſeen as yet; but take away that, and they are deſcribed by the ſame in a more excellent degree then what
<pb n="554" facs="tcp:46484:264"/> is now before us. The Promiſes of God are declared by Meat, Drink, Riches, Pleaſures, Gold, Peace, Joy and ſuch like, of which we now taſte and feel; ſo the threatning by what we abhor and dread. God deals with us as Children, he trains us on by little and little; by what we do gueſs and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, he leads us on to know more things then theſe. <hi>The Law was our School-Maſter to bring us to Chriſt,</hi> it taught by ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments and beggarly elements, this was neceſſary to bring to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards more Perfection. By him we have more knowledge of God, and more yet when we ſhall come to the ſight and fruiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of him. Who did firſt think of Heaven by outward things, may conceive, that there they ſhall have that moſt compleat and ſatisfactory Happineſs, which theſe are a faint Shadow and Repreſentation of. Our Bodies and all Senſible things ſhall be made ſpiritual: This Heaven and Earth ſhall be done away, and a new one ſucceed more glorious. Then ſpiritual and inviſible things will be as perfectly known, as what is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and we now ſee. We begin with Sence, then comes Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and after ſucceeds Faith, and further we cannot go whilſt here in the Body, then to conjecture, and be able to act here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by after things unutterable. <hi>Eye hath not ſeen, nor Ear heard, neither have entered into the Heart of Man the things which God hath prepared for them that love him: But God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit: for the Spirit ſearcheth all things, yea the deep things of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 2. 9, 10. What was at firſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed Madneſs and Strange things, will at length appear to him that ſhall attend and conſider throughly, the exaltation of our Underſtanding; to be Wonderful indeed, but yet moſt True. There is hardly any thing but hath an extream: And though the Soul of Man be of large extent; yet ſhe hath her bounds now in the Priſon of the Body. It is poſſible ſhe may tranſgreſs and go beyond them, and ſo turn into Diſtracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

Of this ſort are thoſe wild Fancies and extravagant Notions, unwarranted Revelations, thoſe portentous Opinions, which like Monſters in nature
<pb n="555" facs="tcp:46484:264"/> ſerve for nothing but make manifeſt what is Perfect and True. When the ſtrings of a Muſical Inſtrument are ſcrued too hard, they are next to be broken; Even the Faculties and Powers of knowing, may by the unadviſed owners thereof, be ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo far as to loſe themſelves; for if people will go further, and beſides what God hath revealed, they will not be ſooner amazed and confounded then at Divine things.

               <p>Which is well worthy of conſideration, (for this makes the way to Heaven ſo ſtreight and narrow, that it conſiſts in the middle between two extreams, which is eaſie to run out of one into the other) and the Ignorant World willingly continue to abuſe the aforeſaid place; for they cry out againſt vain curioſity, as an excuſe for their blindneſs.

Whatever is contained in, or may be manifeſtly inferred out of theſe, and which may incline us unto univerſal Obedience to Almighty God; all this ought to be known. It is true what God ſaith by the Prophet, <hi>My People are deſtroyed for lack of Knowledge; becauſe thou haſt rejected Knowledge, I will alſo reject thee, that thou ſhalt be no Prieſt unto me,</hi> Hoſ. 4. 6.

They cry out of many things, it is better not to know them; ſuch are the Evils and Miſeries of Life, and what may be hereafter, they vex enough when they come to paſs, we need not anticipate them before their time This is the ſence of the World, <hi>Who will ſhew us any good?</hi> is the queſtion of everyone: But the Contemplation of evil is a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy ſubject, they have not ſo much Courage as to admit of that. But can they conſider of thus much? Whether it is not better to think of evil, then to ſuffer it? nay, if by ſo doing they may avoid it, then by not thinking at all to let it come upon them? Is it not better to walk in the Light, ſo ſee the danger and paſs by it? Or elſe to go on in Darkneſs, not to be ſenſible of any evil, but to drop irrecoverably into it?
<pb n="558" facs="tcp:46484:266"/> If there was no redreſs nor help to be found for the preventing thereof before it comes, then not to conſider before-hand was the happy way. If there was no hope nor proviſion to be made concerning Death, that the Sting might be taken away; if it was irreſpectively determined how it ſhould be after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, for my part I do ſincerely wiſh, and would have people continue as ignorant as poſſible they can, that they ſhould not plague themſelves before-hand with the fearful Expectation. The more they did know or conſider, it would give a more deep reſentment of Miſery. Let them whilſt here enjoy all the good they can, and be wholly unmindful of what is to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed. Comfort themſelves for the days wherein they ſhall ſuffer Adverſity, Riot and Sport themſelves before the time of Darkneſs draws on. But I cannot tell, Whether I ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend this or no, unleſs thoſe Pleaſures which now die in the enjoyment would be utterly forgotten, for otherwiſe the remembrance of them would heighten the Miſery and make it worſe. If things were ſo, we men were of all Creatures moſt miſerable. But <hi>Bleſſed and ever Bleſſed be our God,</hi> it is not ſo with us. He hath been pleaſed to order and eſtabliſh, that every one may be happy that will, and none is miſerable but by his own fault. All things are contrived in his Word for the Salvation of all; in every ſingle Soul there are powers im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted to work it out, and means are afforded. <hi>Mine Eyes have ſeen thy Salvation, which thou haſt prepared before the Face of all people,</hi> Luke 2. 30, 31. It is laid before them, <hi>And all things are ready,</hi> Mat. 22. 4. It is only left to Men, whether they will come. So they are warned to eſcape the evil. There is no way of keeping off all evil whatſoever, but there is of avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the great and dreadful one, and turning all the leſſer into good. There is no ſafety by not knowing it, for then it will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly come and prevail over the Man; but by ſeeing thereof he may hide himſelf. And this can never be done unleſs by the Knowledge thereof; ſo it is equally neceſſary to our Happineſs and Safety, as of Good. This is that excellent Wiſdom fully to perceive and know all humane affairs, both good and bad; to think ſuch a thing may happen even before it doth, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare accordingly; in ſome things it may prevent, or get ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter againſt the Storm. Not to be careleſs and neglectful, ſo that he may afterwards repent when paſt remedy; to be ſure
<pb n="559" facs="tcp:46484:266"/> againſt fruitleſs Wiſhes, or the Fools ſaying; to fore-ſee what doth nearly concern him, &amp; that nothing ſhall fall out unthought of, or unexpected. <hi>The Way of Life is above to the Wiſe, that he may depart from Hell beneath,</hi> Pro. 15. 24.</p>
               <p>Men are affrightened with ſlender appearances; for this horrible thing, the meditation of evil, to him that approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth nigh, and is acquainted there-with, is not ſo irkſome as at firſt imagined. It is the policy of Satan to keep off from all Knowledge that may do Good or hinder Evil; but when the Soul comes to be throughly ſenſible thereof, ſhe will purſue after it, and reſolutely paſs through that little harſhneſs and difficulty, which it makes a ſhew of at firſt. It is not ſuch an unpleaſant work to avoid a trouble or inconveniency, and to do this it is neceſſary to conſider of it throughly: In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner it is to thoſe evils which would be worſe and more into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable, if not prevented. The moſt terrible things are Death, Judgment and Hell: But there is a way found out for every one that will live unto him, to die in the Lord; and ſo he is bleſſed. By loving and imitating of him now, <hi>He may have boldneſs in the day of Judgment,</hi> 1 John 4. 17. for the laſt and moſt dreadful of all, he ſhall never come near it. As he may be thus ſecured when future things ſhall be preſent; ſo even now he may think of, and provide as to them, that he is not tormented at the apprehenſion of them. In this he is more ſafe and happy then thoſe heedleſs ones, who are afraid to ſuffer the thoughts of them in their mind, but blindly go on and expoſe themſelves to the full danger.</p>
               <p>The Promiſes of God here are with exception of the Croſs, to comfort and make able to bear it, to carry us through this imperfect and miſerable condition; but thoſe to come are abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute and gracious of enjoyment of all Good, and freedom from all Evil. Even theſe which ſeem harſh diſpenſations of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence work together for our good, and ſo come to paſs as are ſpoken of, or may be learned out of the Word. As to thoſe future rewards and puniſhments, <hi>The Kingdom prepared for us,</hi> and the <hi>Fire prepared for the Devil and his Angels:</hi> We may perceive him even now ſubtilly inſinuating himſelf into the Hearts of Men, ſeeking all ways and means to keep and turn people from God, and that which is good, to hinder them from his favour and Heaven appointed for us. The <hi>Tempter</hi> and
<pb n="560" facs="tcp:46484:267"/> 
                  <hi>Abaddon</hi> doth try to hurt and deſtroy; he is the Author of all evil in the World. If we are afraid we ſhall fall by his hands, it is only our own ſault; for we are called upon to come under the Protection of our God, who hath given his Word and Truth, to diſcover all the Falſhood and Deceits of the Enemy, and then they may be eaſily avoided.</p>
               <p>The moſt valuable things in the World are leaſt regarded. How doth Wiſdom expoſtulate, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1. And though it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens ſo with her before Men, yet all ſhe ſaith there is true, and eſpecially at the concluſion of the Chapter, <hi>Whoſo hearkeneth to me ſhall dwell ſafely, and ſhall be quiet from the fear of evil.</hi> The reaſon why ſhe is ſlighted, is becauſe they refuſe to hear her voice. They put it off with <hi>Scorning</hi> and <hi>hating of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge;</hi> But if they would attend to her Words, the whole World would go after her, as much at ſhe is contemned now. And this would be true of the <hi>Power of Godlineſs,</hi> as it is now of <hi>the Form thereof:</hi> Which indeed hath the vogue and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem, but the other lies under deſpiſing and reproach. Theſe are the Refuges that ignorant and miſtaken Souls betake them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves unto; for it is reaſonable to uſe the ſame diligence after the good things to come, as themſelves ſeek earneſtly after pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and fading Delights; and to ſecure our ſelves againſt the Puniſhment threatned, which is juſt begun here, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               <p>It is eaſie for ſome to aſperſe what they do not underſtand, and others thus cunningly ſeek to hide their own falſhood and error. Reflections come in to ſupply the defect of Reaſon on their ſide; and through the wicked Pride, <hi>as ſlight of Men,</hi> they would ſeem to paſs it by as weak, which indeed is too ſtrong for them to get over and anſwer. The higheſt Wiſdom, even the <hi>Wiſdom of God</hi> may be ridiculed; but when it is only ſo, it is a certain ſign that it cannot be reſiſted. The greateſt Truth may be depraved and reviled; but when it is only ſo, that is firm and unanſwerable. And further, thoſe do always decline from it, <hi>By Reaſon of whom the way of Truth, is evil ſpoken;</hi> which ſhew the general ſence of mankind, that they approve of this as excellent, for they find fault when thoſe perſons who ſeem Religious, do not live accordingly. Even Hypocrites tend to the glory of our Religion, as appears to him who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amines
<pb n="561" facs="tcp:46484:267"/> throughly. But God is outwardly diſhonoured by them; Either when themſelves do not believe what they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, and then what lieth in them, they turn the Truth of God into a Lie. Or they ſurmiſe before the World that the thing is impracticable, and ſo render him liable to the imputation of an hard Maſter, and that his Commandments are grievous; which is abominably falſe: Or when the Doctrines of God are judged of through the practices of Men, then indeed thoſe which are Holy and Good, may ſeem to be Abominable and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil; whereas they do not keep cloſe, or pervert and turn them through their evil nature. When they who ſhall confeſs with their Mouth that God is only wiſe, and ſo is his Law; but yet not obſerve or tranſgreſs it out of a pretence to Wiſdom and Diſcretion, Do not theſe contradict that in their deeds? And for this cauſe God may be evil thought of by Strangers, and that his Sanctions are not ſo wiſely contrived for our living in this World.</p>
               <p>The temporizing accomodating Humour, thoſe cunning ways of avoiding preſent inconvenience, or ſaving themſelves from loſs and danger, thoſe compliances and actings contrary to Conſcience and Duty towards God, all theſe paſs current with ſome for excellent prudential Rules, any Law or Ordinance to the contrary notwithſtanding. Indeed the Commandments of our God are with great Wiſdom ordered to try our Love and Obedience unto him, but not ſo much for preſent eaſe and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity in the World. It is called the Doctrine of the Croſs, <hi>Yea, and all that will live Godly in Chriſt Jeſus, ſhall ſuffer Perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> 2 Tim. 3. 12. Neither let any pretended wiſe Chriſtians (who call themſelves ſo) ſtave it off as long as they can; and when the methods of their own Wiſdom are run out, or they are confounded and baffled, then only apply this to themſelves. But whoſoever, even in theſe days, will ſtrictly and univerſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obſerve his Laws and Directions; who is fully reſolved to keep a good Conſcience in all things, ſhall endure Perſecution or Reproach, and other Worldly loſſes or inconveniences. And yet all this (a ſtrange Paradox!) is very reconcileable with true Wiſdom; for what can be more reaſonable, then to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to a little Evil in order to a greater Good? to ſuffer Loſs for Gain and Advantage, to willingly undergo an Inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to obtain a greater Benefit? this is the ſame what is practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="562" facs="tcp:46484:268"/> every day. Now Chriſtians do believe the Goſpel to be true, and then what our Lord ſaith may be relied on. <hi>There is</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Mark 10. 29, 30.</note> 
                  <hi>no Man that hath forſaken Father or Mother, Houſes or Lands for my ſake, but ſhall receive eternal Life.</hi> That God who will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward us for the leaſt act of Obedience, even to a Cup of cold Water, will alſo take notice of whatever Trouble or Loſs we endure purely for his ſake. We may truſt him as to that: If this be fooliſhneſs we will be accounted ſo, and wait till it is manifeſted to be the higheſt Wiſdom. The promiſes for Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Loſs are ſo full and many, that one may more ſafely venture on this bottom to be returned into the other World; as daily Wiſe Men do to remote Countries when Ship-wrack, Caſualty, their own Death frequently hinder themſelves from being partakers of what they certainly parted withall. Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever doth not only ſay ſo, but really believeth on God, hath more aſſurance from him, <hi>whom it is impoſſible to lie.</hi> His good things promiſed and reſerved are altogether as worthy to be depended on. And though they ſurmiſe, the return may be long; however it is ſhort before, and certain that we go hence, and we will truſt our God for what may be hereafter. But what if it ſhould be ſaid, that as to this preſent time we are no loſers? All things are deſired for Contentment and preſent Happineſs; again, we abhor and are afraid upon the account of Evil and Miſery. Now if God doth continue this ſtill, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſo much of thoſe outward means; if he only permits the ſuperfluities to be taken away, but inſtead of them gives grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Peace and Satisfaction then they would yield, What harm is in all this? Thoſe who <hi>take joyfully the ſpoiling of their Goods,</hi> as ſome have done, are in the ſame or rather a better condition then thoſe who have kept them; for they have not that degree of rejoycing. And ſo he that <hi>can finiſh his Courſe with Joy,</hi>

                  <hi>when Bonds and Afflictions every where abide him,</hi> is as happy as thoſe at full Liberty; for they do not ſo. Indeed all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences of this Life are little; but when they are willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſubmitted unto out of Conſcience towards God, he ſanctifies and ſweetens them unto us, and we are contented as if we had them not all. It is ſmall whatever we can do to teſtifie our Love and Obedience unto God, the utmoſt is to part with Life for his ſake when it is taken away by Wicked Men: God is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to try many of his Servants thus far, to ſee what they will
<pb n="563" facs="tcp:46484:268"/> endure for him; and to let the wickedneſs of Men go on, that he may behold what they will do againſt him. Let none object fooliſhneſs to the Sufferers; <hi>For in their falling they ſtay on him, who gave them and all Mankind Life and Breath.</hi> What can be more reaſonable then to Sacrifice that up unto him, which he lent them at firſt? to Glorifie God by their Death, when he will raiſe them up again and reward them? In all Chriſtian Sufferings it is to turn gainer for the other World; the more thou ſhalt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure, the more thou ſhalt be Crowned; it is a laying in a Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt the time to come, and (if I may ſo ſpeak) a put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <note place="margin">Iſa. 61. 7.</note> in for a greater ſhare of Glory. The more thou art deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and abhorred by Men, the more thou ſhalt be had in honour; for cruel Mockings and Scourgings, there will be Commendations, and thoſe ſhall be healed and done away: for being Deſtitute, Afflicted, Tormented, will ſucceed greater degrees of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Happineſs. I do not admire that thoſe Primitive and Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Souls, when they were lodged in the Body as we are now, and beſet with the ſame Temptations, and of like paſſions; yet did ſo deſire Martyrdom, and ſeek after Suffering, even ſo far, that they did run to a pious extream of well-meaning forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. We again decline it as much; their Faith was more lively, but we, that do ſtand in the latter days on the earth, find that decay thereof our Lord foretold; which makes Men willing to ſhift it off by lawful or unlawful means; and when all theſe fail, then only they are for turning Martyrs and Suffering for Chriſt. It is a good expedient to begin by little and little, and try firſt whether we can hold a Finger in the Flame before we expoſe the whole Body to the Fire; Whether we can endure a little Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, Loſs, to be forſaken, and other trifling Inconveniencies, before we come to the greater Afflictions of the Goſpel. The leaſt have their reward. If this be abſurd and ſimple Doctrine, it muſt be only ſo with Unbelievers. Let a <hi>Plutarch</hi> or <hi>Epicte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> (who did ſee no further then this preſent time; who might talk, but did not know of more then the conveniency of this Life) deliver that prudent Aphoriſm, 'He that accomedates himſelf to the preſent affairs is Wiſe, <hi>But we have not ſo l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

There is no great danger of being miſtaken; for the lines of Good and Evil, Duty and Sin are ſo clearly written in the Hearts of all (eſpecially of thoſe who arrive to that emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency as to ſuffer for God's ſake) that he may perfectly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand them.

Whereas ſincerity will oblige on ſtill; and he that really deſigns for the Kingdom above, will paſs through the Tribulation which lies in the way. Therefore it is to be preſumed he knows it, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not avoid without going out, which he will not do. It is truly ſaid, The Cauſe and not the Paſſion doth make the Martyr; yet if he who hath no Pride nor vain-Glory, no Siniſter impul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, but is acted by the alone Principle of a good Conſcience, whereof no Man can judge but himſelf; however, if he ſhould be deceived as to that, ſeeing it is not out of wilful ignorance (for that is far from the Godly) without queſtion God will be Merciful and reward his honeſt meaning to ſerve and obey him. An upright and ſincere mind is very acceptable with him. <hi>I will ſpare them, as a Man ſpareth his own Son that ſerveth him,</hi> Mal. 3. 17. Now if a Child ſhould do a thing with a good intent to pleaſe his Father, though he did not require it, yet ſtill the good will and intent is accepted; the ſame it is of God towards us Men. If this be not true Divinity, we are left at the greateſt uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that can be; for we are all but Babes and Sucklings to God, the higheſt acts of our Soul are but ignorance before him.

The like we have in our days, who will talk yet higher in contempt of thoſe things, and yet more eagerly ſeek after them; who catch at what they can, get as much as they are able, and then ſpeak forth in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the reſt. I am afraid this will be the Condemnation, that Men will not do that for the Grace and Fear of God, what others formerly did by Philoſophy and vain Boaſting. That we who know and profeſs to believe greater things enforced with Promiſes and Threatnings, yet will not do ſo much to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards renouncing unlawful and abſtracting from preſent things,
<pb n="566" facs="tcp:46484:270"/> as they did. The Wiſdom ſet before us is greater, but Man will not believe or not conform to it: both which are unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and fooliſh. There is certainly ſome ſecret Enemy of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind whom they ſee not, that keeps them off. Men could not do this of themſelves, for they may be aſſured, Heaven will not drop into their Mouth: it is as worthy to be ſought after as the things of this World, and doing but the ſame would bring us to the other. Only as to this nothing ſtops, but to that <hi>One doth let, and will let until he be taken away;</hi> He ſtands at our Elbow, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let us know ſo much, bid him ſtand off, pray againſt his Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, go to the Word of God and we ſhall not be ignorant of his devices, and ſo be too cunning for him, as we may by the aſſiſtance offered us. If it was a matter of indifferency, we could never be ſo backward to a thing that appears ſo very reaſonable, and makes ſuch exceeding and aſſured Propoſals of Good. <hi>Who is Wiſe, and he ſhall underſtand theſe things? Prudent, and he ſhall know them?</hi> Hoſ. 14. 9. <hi>And unto Man he ſaid, Behold the Fear of the Lord, that is Wiſdom, and to depart from Evil is <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtand<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing,</hi> Job 28. 28.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Of RIGHTEOUSNESS and JUSTICE.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>
                  <hi>THerefore all things whatſoever ye would that Men ſhould do unto you, do you even ſo to them, for this is the Law and the Prophets,</hi> Mat. 7. 12. Conſider your ſelves exactly in the ſame circumſtances and condition as the Perſon is with whom you deal, and then let ſincere and impartial Reaſon determine what thou wouldſt have done to thee, and ſo do unto him. Here is a plain Rule given to know what is Juſt or not, whether one doth Right or Wrong. <hi>Thou ſhalt love thy Neighbour as thy ſelf,</hi> is the Epitome of the ſecond Table; and the particular Precepts thereof, are but to give him what is juſt and equal according to the relation he ſtands in, and that we ſhould do him no wrong in thoſe Inſtances, or whatſoever comes under them. The Prophets did mightily inſiſt and preſs to the obſervation of the Law; throughout all their Writings are Inculcations to Judgment, Juſtice and Righteouſneſs; and much Threatning from God againſt Oppreſſion, Theft, Deceit, Lying, Bribery, and ſuch like. <note place="margin">Iſa. 1. Jer. 7. 9, 10, 11.</note> They did unvail the Hypocriſie of thoſe, who did make pretences to Devotion, and thence think they might commit injurious Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; becauſe they did ask God forgiveneſs, and yet retain the Sins of griping the Poor, ſpoiling the Fatherleſs and Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, and the ſeveral acts of Unrighteouſneſs. This enraged the People, for ſo doth any thing which lights upon Luſt or fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied Intereſt: And they to conceal or excuſe their own Shame, did fall from one Wickedneſs to another; from a leſſer to a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter degree of Wrong; from being injurious to their common Neighbours, to Perſecuting their own Prophets alſo. They might thus Palliate the matter before ſhort-ſighted Men, <hi>But all things are naked and opened unto the Eyes of him with whom we have to do.</hi> Heb. 4. 13. And by this way they did provoke him yet more. Even now, Whoſoever is an Enemy to Religion, or to thoſe ſet up in defence of it, he doth ſomething which that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns;
<pb n="568" facs="tcp:46484:271"/> and therefore ſhews forth Spite and Malice. There doth not ariſe ſuch a bitter rancour in the minds of Men againſt the Word and Ways of God, if it is only for Sin as to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, becauſe for this they may have ſome Extenuation and Pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty from others through infirmity or pleaſing of the Fleſh; <hi>But the Wrath of God is revealed from Heaven againſt all <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngodlineſs, and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nrighteouſneſs of Men,</hi> Rom. 1. 18. and for the ſeveral acts of the laſt they become deſtitute and odious to all that know thereof. We are ſtrictly commanded whatever is Juſt, Honeſt and of good Report; and we are forbidden the contrary. Juſtice is more enjoyned in Scripture, then Piety towards God, which is in the firſt place; or Sobriety to our ſelves. Whether the holy Spirit fore-ſeeing it would be more difficult to keep people unto it, for they ſooner decline and turn aſide there being more Temptation of Worldly Advantage, then is to be had by Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlineſs, or they might miſtake and ſuppoſe to have Devotion paſs for an Atonement and Commutation of their Sin; Or God willing the Happineſs of his Creatures as they lived in a commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; yet he hath aid more throughout his Word of our Duty to our Neighbour then that we ow immediately unto himſelf; Though in Truth all is Homage and Su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>jection unto God, <hi>For we are to do Juſtly and love Mercy, becauſe he doth require it of us,</hi> Mic. 6. 8. This is agreed to be good by all mankind: Upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dealing and Alms-giving have been, are, and will always con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue Honourable and of good eſteem amongſt Men, both good and bad. We may ſee by this they have a real deſire after Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs; for they countenance what they ſee furthers it, and ſhew themſelves diſpleaſed at whatever is prejudicial thereto. They approve what is juſt and equal, when Offices of Kindneſs and Compaſſion are done to one another; and contrariwiſe they ſeek to hinder, if no other way, yet by caſting Shame on the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of Wrong and Injury. There is a general ſence and good Nature to others, though it may be brought home to Self-Love at laſt; yet if he loves others alſo, it is no harm for a Man to love himſelf, he cannot do otherwiſe; and where all things may ſtand together, there is no need of ſhutting one from the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>I might from this Obſervation juſt ask, if this Principle be in all; and Religion only comes on this Errand, as certainly it doth, and for no other; for <hi>God ſent not his Son into the World,
<pb n="569" facs="tcp:46484:271"/> not to condemn the World, but that the World through him might be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,</hi> that is, eternally Happy. Why then ſhould ſo many thoughts ariſe in the Hearts of Men concerning it, as if it were a Troubler and Diſturbance to them, or as it were a <hi>Snare?</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Exod. 10. 7.</note> What mean thoſe ſilent Murmurings, thoſe ſecret and ſtrange Imaginations? Concerning this one thing of Religion, <hi>There are great Thoughts and ſearchings of Heart.</hi> But it is only the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions,</hi> and the not complyance with it in all things, which oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions all this. There is a ſecret Enemy which doth all he can to raiſe Prejudices and wicked ſuggeſtions, to turn (if poſſible) all people from the good that is ſet before them; but he doth the greater Part. There is ſomething in the nature of Man, which catches at every little thing that is preſent, viſible and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, but neglectful of what is not altogether ſo; though Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence would direct that in a thing of infinite greater concern, he ſhould alſo uſe the ſame Care and Caution. He doth indeed wiſely as to the little things of this Life; but then he ſhould go on as he hath begun, doing the ſame as to thoſe vaſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns of the ſucceeding and endleſs Life, and then he acts like a Man indeed; for a Beaſt hath that inſtinct to take care and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion about what is before and uſeful unto him, and to avoid things hurtful: and ſo far let him uſe thoſe faculties he hath, but for them which riſe higher, let them be advanced to the higher end. The Principles of ſelf-Love and willingneſs to be Happy, are as fit to build the Doctrines of Chriſt on as any, for as in the things of this World, when a Man comes to know they tend to this, he preſently deſires and ſeeks after them; ſo if he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands the other are for his good and ſecurity, it is then left unto him whether he will follow after and practice them.</p>
               <p>None can ſo much as in thought accuſe God for thoſe Laws and Statutes he hath given to Mankind as they live in Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood and Society; for thoſe things to be done between Man and Man, every one knows it would be happy living, if they were by all perſons and in all things obſerved, that every Man might have his own, and get what he can more, that we might live Lovingly and Peaceable with one another.</p>
               <p>But ſeeing the World is turned aſide from this good Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <note place="margin">The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer is through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the enſuing Diſcourſe.</note> What ſhall we do now? <hi>He that departeth from Evil maketh himſelf a Prey,</hi> Iſa. 59. 15. One may do Wrong to make up for that which he hath received; there is little to be got by
<pb n="570" facs="tcp:46484:272"/> the ſtrict way of Juſtice. If one will come to any thing, he muſt make uſe of good and evil Arts; the firſt to get a fair Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, but it is good to have a double Advantage. All peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are for living in the World as well as they can. If I had an Eſtate, or ſufficient beſides, I ſhould never have been put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Temptation; but it is hard to periſh for want, there can be no Sin when Neceſſity compels. Moreover, Honeſty is poor and laughed at, ſo it may ſeem neither agreeable to Wiſdom nor Happineſs.</p>
               <p>One would admire, when things were ſo well ordered and diſpoſed of at firſt, and ſuch excellent Rules made concerning them, that they ſhould ever be departed from; But Evil preſently came into the World, the Sons of Violence and Tranſgreſſion ſprang up, Wickedneſs quickly got the greater part of its ſide. But now hereby is had the exerciſe and tryal of Good, for that could not be unleſs there was ſome of the contrary. Nay, it would not be ſo much commended, unleſs there was great abundance of the contrary, and much oppoſition as now there is; ſo that Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs may appear more Righteous. It relies on <hi>Faith,</hi> and ſo is <hi>more precious then of Gold that periſheth,</hi> (then of the gains of Falſhood, which are quickly left behind and come to nothing) <hi>though it be tryed with Fire</hi> (that is with difficulty and reſiſtance) <hi>might be found unto Praiſe, and Honour and Glory at the appearance of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 7. If there was nothing more then what we now ſee, only Buying, Selling and getting Gain; If after this buſie Life we were to lye in the ſluggiſhneſs of eternal an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilation; nothing in the World beſides Earth; no Time ſhall be after we are gone out of the World, or there ſhould be an utter end of us; if there was nothing beſides what we in the hurry of worldly Buſineſs think of, which is evidently falſe; or nothing would ever befall us then what we conſider of before hand, as many things do now; I ſay if things were ſo, which are manifeſtly contrary, then all that aforementioned would be wiſe Counſel, and method of Action. The Men of this World run a little too faſt, they would take up that for granted which is not ſo, and then all along act upon a falſe and miſtaken Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple: for whether they firſt debate it in their minds or no, they do after that manner, as if there was no Immortality and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection; If they would allow an eternal Life after this, as it is the ſame whether they do or do not, it being not what Man
<pb n="571" facs="tcp:46484:272"/> fancies concerning himſelf, but God hath Decreed) all this ſtir of living in the World would fall to the ground; for then na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Reaſon would make this inference, That the time of our So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journing here, if Seventy or Eighty Years, is not ſo much to that as the twinkling of an Eye to our whole Life; and conſequently there ſhould be as much care had to live happily for ever, as now for this ſhort time. If both cannot ſtand together, there the leaſt muſt give place to the greater; for more concern is to be had for a Year then for a Minute only.</p>
               <p>Said one, Who received the Spirit which did lead into all Truth, <hi>Know ye not that the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nrighteous ſhall not inherit the Kingdom of God? nor Thieves, nor Covetous, nor Extortioners ſhall inherit the Kingdom of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 6. 9, 10. So what are accounted the ways of thriving in the World, are an abſolute hindrance to their Title unto that. Men are to be judged by the Scriptures, and according as they have done or tranſgreſſed are to be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted or ſhut out: Now this Book Condemns all the propoſed Schemes of advantage. <hi>What is a Man profited, if he ſhall gain the whole World and loſe his own Soul? Or what ſhall he give in exchange for his Soul?</hi> Mat. 16. 26. The Word of God is different from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ain and common received Opinion. The Tempter firſt inſtils thoſe princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Diſhoneſty: Have they not read, how he was a Liar from the Beginning? He inſinuated to our Parents that the forbidden Fruit ſhould do them no harm; he beguiled them with a promiſe and appearance of Good, but we have found the contrary. The Commandments of God have a ſhew of inconvenience: and Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion may ſeem expedient at firſt; but examine things through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and ſee how it will be then.</p>
               <p>The great Objection againſt this Duty, and therein it hath a ſhew of Folly, that hereby we become liable to be impoſed on, ſuffer Loſs, and are deprived of opportunity of more Gain. Our Lord's Counſel and Command is, <hi>Be Wiſe as Serpents, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent as Doves.</hi> Be cautious that you do not receive any Injury, and be ſure to do none. Every Man may preſerve his own, and uſe a lawful redreſs where it is taken away by Wrong. The fault found by the Apoſtle, 1 Cor. 6. 6. is when they go to Law before Unbelievers, but in the fore going verſe he ſeems to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit thereof before a Chriſtian Magiſtrate, or rather in the firſt place they ſhould refer it to an Arbitrator. Or if it be for trifles, there one may ſuffer himſelf to be defrauded, and paſs it over
<pb n="572" facs="tcp:46484:273"/> as not worth a wiſe Mans regard, for that is not extended to lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle things. Chriſtianity and Prudence are not in themſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent; but the Error is, that ſome frame notions of Wiſdom according to the Opinion and Practice of the World, and by that would ſtate the obligations of Duty, whereby they make the Commandments of Chriſt of none effect, or by diſtinctions would correct them. But let nothing be done contrary <hi>to the leaſt of them</hi> what<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ver inconveniences may enſue. If we ſuffer Shame or Loſs for the Doctrine of Jeſus, we may truſt him; a more enduring ſubſtance in Heaven will be a ſufficient requital. It doth ſeldom happen that any conſiderable diſadvantage doth fall upon any for keeping ſtedfaſtly to his Laws, when that only and no other is the Reaſon; or if it ſhould, it would be made up another way here or hereafter. <hi>The Meek ſhall inherit the Earth,</hi> Mat. 5. 5. He dwells ſafely, and none cares to moleſt or diſturb him. And though the baſeneſs of ſome little poor Souls may extend ſo far as to Cheat, Defraud and take Advantage over his ſimple Honeſty (as they phraſe it) yet this is done privately and in ſmall inſtances, which either he doth not know or not mind, and ſo lives well and contented for all. <hi>The <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>njuſt knoweth no Shame,</hi> Zeph. 3. 5. He may come at length to be ſo brazen-faced that he doth not value the judgment of Men, but ſo far only is kept in, leaſt humane Law take hold of him; yet through re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining Providence he will ſooner do Wrong to any one, then the univerſally ſincere and good Man. Who did ever want Food and Raiment convenient for him, only by keeping Gods Commandments? It is ſomewhat hard to Fleſh and Blood, but it is ſafe. <hi>Bleſſed is the Man that truſteth in him. O Fear the Lord ye his Saints, for there is no want to them that fear him. The young Lyons do lack and ſuffer Hunger; but they that ſeek the Lord ſhall not want any good thing,</hi> Pſal. 34 8, 9, 10. It is Gods Will that they ſhall comply with his Ordinance of Labour, and not be <hi>ſlothful in Buſineſs;</hi> ſo they being in ſome Calling and adding there to Honeſty and Diligence, do not want what is good or neceſſary for them. <hi>The Eyes of the Lord are over the Righteous,</hi> but then they muſt not tempt God, or expect a Miracle that he ſhould feed them as once he did the Prophet with Ravens, but they are to uſe the means he hath appointed. Though we do live by Faith, and God is not willing that any thing ſhould be made too evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, for that would deſtroy this noble Principle, and take off
<pb n="573" facs="tcp:46484:273"/> from the excellency of Obedience; yet to eſtabliſh our Truſt and Dependance on him, he diſcovers himſelf more then in any thing. We may as it were ſee with our Eyes his Watchful and eſpecial Providence over his own Servants; Thoſe peculiar ones redeemed from all Iniquity do get a livelyhood. Or if they are diſabled and hindred from Work or Imployment, he provides ſome other way. Still he acts moſt wiſely who lives ſo in this World that he may live for ever. <hi>He that walketh Righteouſly and ſpeaketh uprightly, He that deſpiſeth the gain of Oppreſſion, that ſhaketh his hands from holding of Bribes,</hi> Iſa. 33. 15. Who uſeth Lawful and prudent means according to the Trade and Occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation he is in, and rejects whatever is of Craft and Evil. It is ſometimes ſeen that he may proſper and increaſe in the World. <hi>His Seed ſhall be mighty upon Earth: the Generation of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pright ſhall be Bleſſed; Wealth and Riches ſhall be in his Houſe,</hi> Pſa. 112. 2, 3. This was often fulfilled in old time under the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, who had great meaſure of temporal Bleſſings. At this time it may be obſerved, whether for their Worſhip and Service of God, or the favour he retains to the Children of <hi>Abraham</hi> the Sons of <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Joſeph,</hi> or whatever Reaſon we may in Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity gueſs at; yet they are generally in good eſtate and plenty, though ſcattered in the World. But to us Chriſtians are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of better things <hi>of the Life that now is, and that which is to come,</hi> one in order to the other, as the divine Wiſdom thinks fit. Thoſe who are Heirs of Salvation, for whom the greater things are reſerved, do commonly live by his Grace and good Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence here in expectation and purſuit after that. More is not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired then ſufficient for this. They look further then barely to live, but do ſomething worthy of Life, which is only towards that to come. As they get means for the firſt, they preſs forward to the high and eternal Calling.</p>
               <p>There is much talk of living, and living well in the World; this is the principal Mark at which moſt aim, to get in an high condition, and as much as ever they can. It may be obſerved that whilſt in our Mothers Womb we grow up as Plants, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards like young Beaſts, we Eat, Drink, Sleep and Play till the Organs come to be fitted for the exerciſe of Reaſon, then we become Men; but yet many live like Beaſts all their days pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing only the ſame end: and that which was deſigned to ſeek af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter divine things, degenerates and ſerves only to miniſter unto
<pb n="574" facs="tcp:46484:274"/> the Brutiſh part of Man. If he would keep in his honour and underſtanding, and advance further; if he hath really Prudence and Diſcretion, he might know thus much, that when the Lower ends are attained, he ſhould riſe higher. When Hunger and Thirſt are ſatisfied, what is all this for, but to ſeek after the Bread of Heaven, and to thirſt after the Wells of Salvation? When what he eats every day with his Mouth is caſt into the draught, and ſignifies no more but for the preſent, hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> common and daily Work according to Gods Ordinance ſupplies him with that; when he ſees this comes to no more but juſt to keep life for the time, this ſuggeſts <hi>not to labour for the Meat which periſheth, but for the Meat which endureth unto everlaſting Life.</hi> When our Clothes wax old and new are had, which are daily put on and off, there is dreſſing and making neat; What is all this for, but to fit us unto ſomething elſe? to ſeek unto the <hi>Lord to be Clothed with the Garments of Salvation, and to be covered with the Robe of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,</hi> Iſa. 61. 10. <hi>to be arrayed in fine Linnen, clean and white,</hi> Rev. 19. 8. Doth not the Body wax old with the Raiment it weares? Hath it not the like changes? going to Bed puts in mind of lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſide theſe Rags of Fleſh in the Chamber of the Grave; The Morning may be an Emblem of the Reſurrection; our do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame things ſhews forth the Happineſs of Heaven, which doth not ſo much conſiſt in infinite and ſucceſſive variety, but all imperfection and tireſomeneſs ſhall be done away, and we ſhall have full and ſatisfactory Objects for our deſires. The waſhing and making neat prompts to <hi>cleanſe our ſelves from all filthineſs of Fleſh and Spirit.</hi> The rubbing away the dirt contracted by the ſordes of the Body or outward things, teaches to be pure Men and Women juſt, as we were made, without additional Plaiſtering or Colour. This again puts upon <hi>adorning the hidden Man of the Heart, which is not corruptible;</hi> and all in order to be glorified both in Body and Soul hereafter. Still Men do act but half way; this living in the World points out what is to be done towards, and as it were ſhews unto us the <hi>endleſs Life.</hi> This Life is lent to make ready for the other. It is an eſſential part of Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to refer all things to the moſt excellent end, to have an Eye ſtill fixt upon that, and then order our going accordingly. Wherefore do I live here theſe few days, and full of trouble? To behold the Heavens at a great diſtance, and ſee the outſide only, as we do not much more of the Earth we tread on; to
<pb n="575" facs="tcp:46484:274"/> run through that Succeſſion of Day and Night, Summer and Winter, and that ſmall variety of things nearer to us, Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, Buſineſs, neceſſary Actions, we are quickly weary with all this; but there being much more as Gods Revelation ſpeaks of, our Life was given to great ends and purpoſes, wherein the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Creator hath manifeſted his own Wiſdom and Glory. And then, Is not Immortality more to be minded, then a dying Life? Is not Perfection rather to be ſought after, then to lie down un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der our Imperfection? If one was wholly to be given up, yet ſtill the greater good is to be preferred before the leſs; but when they may both ſtand together, nay, if the leſs is better managed when it is towards attainment of the other, this will be a mighty Argument for the equality of Gods Ways towards Men. If the Life that now is may as well, yea be better continued and preſerved by ordering it ſo as God would have it in purſuance to the eternal Life he hath promiſed, this demonſtrates him to be moſt Righteous, but our ſelves unreaſonable and fooliſh if we do not comply therewith. This is done by getting neceſſaries and conveniencies, then in the uſe and exerciſe of them. The Grace of God hath excellently preſcribed for both, <hi>Teaching that we ſhould live Soberly and Righteouſly in this preſent World,</hi> Tit. 2. 12.</p>
               <p>But we are to be advertiſed of what our Lord ſaith, <hi>A Mans Life conſiſteth not in the abundance of things which he poſſeſſeth,</hi> Luke 12. 15. It requireth no more then Meat, Drink, Raiment, Habitation convenient for him, remembring ſtill what he is, where he is, and whither he is going. A noble Soul enrapt in Fleſh, and therefore is for the pure deſires of that only: By the <hi>Well</hi> and in the <hi>Wilderneſs;</hi> and therefore is to have a refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, no continued ſitting down; ſome divertiſement and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, but no perfect and laſting Happineſs till he is come to the place God hath provided for him. Since things are ſo as we are told in his Word, and find True by Conſideration out of it, If we might not be carried through here by going his Way, and according to his Directions, then there was ſome excuſe for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt and revolt from him, as now there is none at all. On whom may we more ſafely depend, then the God who giveth Food to all Fleſh? <hi>Who ſeedeth the Fowls of the Air, albeit they Sow not, neither do they Reap,</hi> Mat. 6. 26. much more would he
<pb n="576" facs="tcp:46484:275"/> feed us alſo, as we are better then they in the Rank of Creatures; but yet more, as we would ſhew our ſelves Obedient Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>
               <p>This is the more certain way of getting a comfortable Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence, for every one both Juſt or Unjuſt, would willingly have to do with an honeſt Man, ſo hereby he hath more Cuſtom or Employment. This is ſo evident, that all at leaſt pretend and make a ſhew of being ſo, though few act according, and keep cloſe to the true rules thereof. It is juſt and equal that one Man ſhould live by another, that anothers Calling ſhould maintain him, as we are willing our own ſhould as to us: This is agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the Royal and Fundamental Law; provided that no De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, Lying, Over-reaching or other Sin be committed on this excuſe, for under this they do ſhelter Unrighteouſneſs and Wrong. The nature of Evil is fixt in it ſelf, and is not to be done under any pretended Good. None would care to be impoſed upon, or ſerved after an indirect manner himſelf. The Sin of Diſhoneſty is ſo ſhameful, odious and prejudicial to Intereſt in the World, that thoſe who do not fear God nor have regard to futurity, will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal or mitigate it as much as they can; for their Credit is their Livelihood, and if they loſe that they loſe all, none will deal with them. So Honeſty is the beſt Policy in this World; the form thereof is for temporal Advantage, and ſo is the thing it ſelf. It is thought otherwiſe; the beſt way is to have the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Reputation, but privately to do any thing for Gain. This is the received Maxim, but contrary to Chriſtian ſimplicity and ſincerity, nor yet ſo very reconcileable with Prudence; for the moſt hidden Deceit, eſpecially when long uſed, will ſome way or other manifeſt it ſelf, ſo far at leaſt as to render him ſuſpected, if not known; and then he ſhall loſe more of honeſt gain which he might have had, and will not be recompenced with all the Wages of Iniquity. If it be ſtrictly conſidered in ordinary Trade or Buſineſs, how much may be really gotten within the bounds of Uprightneſs, what is to be had more, by going over, is ſo little and inconſiderable that it doth more harm then good. All Actions proceed from the mind, and as that is diſpoſed ſo are they; if to injuſtice then either by continued cloſe acts thereof, or by deſpiſing thoſe little ways of Diſhoneſty, and by propoſing ſome one conſiderable Oppreſſion or Deceit, which makes his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune;
<pb n="577" facs="tcp:46484:275"/> this is reckoned the wiſer way, by which they come to ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what, when before by being exact and true in leſſer matters they were loſs ſuſpected.</p>

How many Examples of this ſort? Their Griping and Covetouſneſs, their ſecret acts of Knavery and other Abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable doings, make all conſidering people take heed and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of them. Many that ſeem to be ſo, have given ſufficient occaſion for this. Some by Rebellion in the State, others by pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Dealings between their Neighbours have made the Way of Truth evil ſpoken of. But doth this allow of their doings? Do they not vary from it? Who can help but there will be Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites? The Word of God is full and manifeſt againſt all manner of Unjuſt doing, The Rule is ſtrait and right, for Hypocrites (who would be accounted Righteous when they are not) pretend to Religion, becauſe that requires Honeſty, and under that Cloak they would cover themſelves. If their Practices are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, that makes known their Religion to be vain; they have only an appearance, but not the reality thereof, for notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this ſtill remains Juſt and Good. There are three general Principles of Action, <hi>Conſcience, Honour</hi> and <hi>Intereſt;</hi> the firſt is a ſure reſtraint, the ſecond is none at all where the thing can be done ſecretly, as too many acts of Injuſtice daily are; And if Men are Honeſt only for their Intereſt, they will be likewiſe Diſhoneſt when it is their Intereſt ſo to be, as that often hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens. <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The Temptation of Intereſt is ſo prevalent, that he muſt be a perfect Man indeed who is not wrought on thereby, One who is endued with a good meaſure of the Grace and Fear of God; but he that hath not, will be quickly overcome, for he who doth not ſeek his Happineſs from God, will be working it out him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf;
<pb n="578" facs="tcp:46484:276"/> and this being the Principal Inſtrument that helps to all things of a Mans own Happineſs, he will be ſure to manage it to the beſt advantage he can: By Right or Wrong, Lawful or Unlawful means is no matter to him, who is for getting every way. There is no check nor ſtop to the violent driving on of Intereſt but Religion. Why ſhould that hinder the good of any Man? It doth not in any wiſe. It provides againſt wrongfully taking from another. But wouldſt thou ſtand ſtill, and pauſe a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle.</p>
               <p>Wherefore is the beloved and magnified Intereſt deſired? Is it not in order to the attainment of Happineſs, and if that may be had in a better and only true way, What harm is in all this? you are not forbidden to Trade or get Gain, you are required to provide for your Houſe and Family, but you are denied the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluities of unlawful Profit. Both the neceſſaries and Conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies of Life and Contentment withal, may and are only to be obtained by keeping within the fence of Duty. <hi>The Bleſſing of the Lord maketh Rich, and he added no Sorrow with it;</hi> So that is rather to be choſen then filthy Lucre, the great Gains of Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion and Injuſtice to which a Curſe is annexed, <hi>Job</hi> 15. 29. &amp; <hi>Job</hi> 20. 18, 19, 20, 23. There may be a <hi>Curſe in the Mouth,</hi> and ſuch may have no true enjoyment of what they obtain this way. They are continually plagued with ſecret and inviſible twinges, which themſelves feel and ſeek to ſtupifie by Drunkenneſs, Glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony, conſtant Company, great hurry of Buſineſs, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Arts of hardening. <hi>A little that a Righteous Man hath, is better then the Riches of many Wicked,</hi> Pſal. 37. 16. He hath a more comfortable enjoyment of what provides againſt Hunger and Thirſt, is a defence againſt cold and nakedneſs, and as to them he reſts ſatisfied. Whereas others can do no more with abundance; and if they give up themſelves to their own Hearts Luſts, they may glut themſelves, but yet crave; have their belly filled, but not their deſire; They may drink on, and ſtill be dry; be ſafe from cold, but not the uneaſineſs of pride. Honeſty and Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence do more conduce to preſent Peace and Comfort, then that diſtracting or weariſome Purſuit after immoderate and forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Gain. For there doth ariſe diſquietude from Guilt and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content, the firſt tormenting him for what he hath done, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond making him reſtleſs to puſh forward to add yet more; and thus he knows not what to do, being toſſed between two Furies,
<pb n="579" facs="tcp:46484:276"/> which keep him uneaſie and troubled. Let Injuſtice put in what Plea ſhe will; make a noiſe for living in the World: yet both for that and being Happy here, the beſt way is to live Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Lord thy God hath Bleſſed thee in all the works of thy Hands,</hi> Deut. 2. 7. He gives thee Skill and Underſtanding; and his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence watches to prevent the miſchievous devices of the Sons of Violence and Falſhood. As none is without Afflictions of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and Mind, ſo not without loſſes in Eſtate. Theſe are ſuffered for Tryal and wiſe Reaſons, but moſt commonly it is ſo ordered that hereby they are not diſabled from their ſeveral Employments; So it ſeldom or never happens in a good Man for his Loſſes to be his utter undoing, or to be abſolutely deprived of a Livelihood. That comes to paſs through Negligence, Folly, Prodigality, or ſome other Sin; but not by keeping cloſe to Duty. And though he may receive ſome little injuries, yet he lives contentedly, at preſent applying the Promiſe, and patiently expects the Reward for doing the Will of God. He need not return Evil for Evil, or more injuriouſly make honeſt People pay for the harm Knaves have done unto him. Theſe are for the moſt part trivial Inſtances, and our Obedience is to be proved as to them. God hath ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that Man ſhould Labour, and he will proſper that to which he intends it, <hi>Mine Elect ſhall long enjoy the work of their Hands, They ſhall not labour in Vain, nor bring forth for Trouble,</hi> Iſa. 65. 23. His word doth as it were ſtand engaged that ſuch who live accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his Will ſhould be mantained: To ſupply real Wants, not unneceſſary Luſts. And it may be obſerved of the greater part of mankind, who have no certain Dependance nor Eſtate, but the caſual income of their Trade or Emploiment from day to day, yet ſtill they are provided for, ſome one way or another. So there is no need of repining at the great Landlord, whoſe is the Earth and the fulneſs thereof, for not giving an Eſtate; Why he hath given enough for all; the Fruits and Cattel (Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed be his goodneſs) are abundantly ſufficient to maintain all its Inhabitants. But he hath ſet Limits, Bounds and Land-marks that every one might know what was his own. And then ſome by Induſtry obtained what others through Negligence and Idleneſs parted withal, the World going on in the uſual way as it doth now. This diverſity is ſuffered by the divine Wiſdom for try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
<pb n="580" facs="tcp:46484:277"/> of that particular Vertue now inſiſted on, and of others. All cannot have Eſtates, not ſuch as they deſire. Every one ought to be contented with that condition he is in; if he will work with his Hands there is no fear of want. Never any is driven ſo hard as to be forced by neceſſity to Sin, if he will uſe all lawful means firſt. Then Honeſty is ſo far from being poor and laughed at, that thoſe who obſerve it, are generally thriving, and have good Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation; but if mean, yet attended with that ſatisfaction of mind which others have not in their abundance. If at any time ridiculed, it is by knaviſh Men who ſeek this way to extenuate their own Guilt; for his well-doing brings their Sin to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance. And truly this is the cauſe of that Reproach, Slander and Contempt caſt upon the ways and People of God; not that they in any wiſe deſerve it, but all good eſteem and honour; But thoſe who do not live accordingly, are privately convicted they are in a fault; and therefore ſeek to diſcountenance that, which they ſhould have done. An odd way, not to be conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted only to offend God by an Omiſſion or Diſobedience; but to Sin yet more by faſtening contempt on his wiſe Sanctions, and to hinder others alſo.</p>

He that doth Righteouſneſs is Righteous, even as he is Righteous. In this the Children of God are manifeſt, and the Children of the Devil.

He doth ſee if any one will do juſtly, and live according to the Laws he hath given; they may be broken ſecretly, but it is known unto him; The hidden things of Diſhoneſty may a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle while remain undiſcerned to our ſight, but not before him who in his appointed time will reveal them openly before the World.

                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>THis puts in mind of our imperfect and wanting Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that ſtands in need of ſo many things from without. The God, who made us, put us in Fleſh, and in this place, who hath ordained ſuch things to nouriſh and ſuſtain us for a while; He could alſo have kept us in Being and Continuance without them. All things are equally poſſible to an Almighty Power. He both frames the means and the end. he is free and unlimited to the uſe of them, or can perform whatever he pleaſes with ſuch means, or without any at all. Who fed the five Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand with five Loaves, could have cauſed that they ſhould not have Hungred at all, as he did not, during the Forty days and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty nights, for <hi>He was afterwards an Hungred,</hi> Mat. 4. 2. <hi>Man doth not live by Bread only, but by every Word that proceedeth out of the Mouth of the Lord doth Man live,</hi> Deut. 8. 3. We are not to be perfect before our time; Even now by the Divine goodneſs and appointment we are in good Accomodation by the help of thoſe outward things, as indeed can be well required for Creatures and the ſtate of Imperfection; all this is only for a while in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of, and in order unto greater things. <hi>Meats for the Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and the Belly for Meats, but God ſhall deſtroy both it and them,</hi> 1 Cor. 6. 13. Our Feet and Eyes ſupply that to us as if we were wholly made up of motion and ſight, they are ſufficient for the buſineſs we have to do. Food and Raiment through Gods Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing keep Life and Strength, and provide againſt Hunger and Cold; ſo as to them we ſuffer no decay. They ſupply the defects,
<pb n="583" facs="tcp:46484:278"/> ſo that ſtill we are rendered fit for our Maſters Service, and for what he doth require of us. They come into help againſt thoſe Evils which would otherwiſe Oppreſs, and for a Prop when we are beginning to fall. It is manifeſt they ſhould only do unto what they ſerve, aſſiſt, but not clog or burthen; they ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh and enable to ſtand, not ſtifle or fit heavy upon us. Hence Temperance appears to be pure and natural; it requires what ever is convenient, but rejects and caſts forth what is more. That there be nothing wanting or over: That the Body be preſerved in its due Temperament, That it ſpring up and run through its ſeveral alterations with daily Bread, the conſtant and even courſe of <hi>Bleſſings of Heaven and Fatneſs of the Earth,</hi> the moderate uſe of thoſe good things God hath prepared for it. Like a <note n="†" place="margin">Iſa. 65. 22.</note> Tree planted which neither hath too much Dung at the Root nor ſtands in a barren Ground, but receives nouriſhment from the Earth, Air, Rain, kind influences of the Sun, until it grows up to full bulk, and thence it will by degrees wither and periſh. Continuance is his only to give who was the firſt Author of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: to every thing here is the appointed time to go on during that by further Laws and Rules. By a narrow and ſtrict obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of things we may diſcover the Glory and Wiſdom of our God; our Reaſon was therefore given to Praiſe and Magnifie him, to know and do things profitable for us.</p>
               <p>Many do miſcarry and come to an haſty end by not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending this, by making that an occaſion to deſtroy themſelves before their time, which was therefore deſigned to carry them through unto the Period thereof. When <hi>the Table proves a ſnare, and that which ſhould be for their welfare, is a Gin to take themſelves withal:</hi> When that which ſhould water and moiſten, doth drown or over-whelm; ſo again when theſe are denied, there ſucceeds an ill conſtitution of the whole. Sickneſs doth ariſe from irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity of Meat and Drink. And though it is commonly imputed to ſuch accidents or ſecond cauſes, yet there is the groſs and ill affection of Humours, which by that have been rendred jarring, and ſuch a thing ſets them in actual falling out. Temperance is the beſt Phyſick according to the old rule approved of by univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Experience ſince the World began; nothing doth ſo keep off and prevent Diſtempers: and when they are on there is no ſuch ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral and good preſcription as Faſting and Abſtinence, that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture may at length expel what clogs and hath diſordered. Health
<pb n="584" facs="tcp:46484:279"/> is the greateſt good pertaining to the Body, which nothing doth ſo much preſerve as Sobriety. And this may be one reaſon why Beaſts are not troubled with Sickneſs and Indiſpoſition as Man is; the Body of both is near the ſame, but they live according to nature, only ſupplying the deſires thereof and no more; whereas he doth add Drunkenneſs to Thirſt, and Gluttony to Hunger. What brings him back to the firſt and true uſe of things, this tends to his well-being.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He that keeps</hi> Iſrael <hi>neither Slumbers nor Sleeps,</hi> neither Eats nor Drinks, nor is Clothed. He needs none of theſe things, for he is God in whom is all fulneſs, Perfection, Self-ſubſiſtency, Eternity, and whatever can be thought of him who is <hi>all in all,</hi> to whom cannot approach the leaſt evil or hurt. So Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance is not in him, being converſant only about the uſe of thoſe things which denote Imperfection. Yet this <hi>Fruit of the Spirit,</hi> Gal. 5. 23. makes us little and finite Creatures have a faint reſemblance to <hi>the God of the Spirits of all Fleſh,</hi> by reducing them to the ſtate they were firſt made in of his Image and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. We hardly know what the Soul is in it Self, being cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red over with Sin and Senſuality, but when ſtript of theſe it returns to its firſt condition. It is active in a healthy and ſound Body, but is preſſed down even to the Earth with loads of Meat and Drink. Then that which is linked on, is drenched and immerſed further in, ſo is hardly diſcerned to be Spirit. For it becomes in a manner carnal and partakes of the Fleſhly part of us, which is a degeneracy and ſinking; ſo when theſe hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drances are taken away, there is a riſing up again. The work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of our Soul are naturally upwards, if the weight is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved.</p>
               <p>Temperance doth further moderate our deſires; it doth not make them abſolutely ceaſe, for that is impoſſible, but takes away the torment of them. When gratified, they are the more eager and impatient, but when reſiſted they are leſs. This brings into that lovely temper of <hi>uſing as not abuſing,</hi> Not to be overcome with the Temptations to exceſs, they will become leſs by denial; and it may be as irkſome to admit thereof, as for the ſenſual minded to reſiſt it. Sobriety perceives all the good in the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures abſtracted from the evil: It hath all the reliſh and ſweetneſs in them, ſeparated from eructation and bitterneſs. Which keeps within the juſt bounds, and knows not the trouble
<pb n="585" facs="tcp:46484:279"/> of going over; which frees from the pain of Hunger, and uneaſineſs of ſatiety; which preſerves Health, and not deſtroys it. The Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is of a more ſtrong and vigorous temper, and the Man is ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred <note place="margin">Prov. 13. 25. Iſa. 23. 18,</note> fit for his general and particular Calling. He is loving and thankful to the giver of all good things. He doth cheerfully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form his Duty to him, and thoſe Offices due unto his Neighbour, and that Buſineſs himſelf hath in the World. This Grace puts joy into the Countenance, and livelineſs into the whole Man; whereas one extream is attended with heavineſs and ſorrow, reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſs and diſcontent, the other makes pale and weak.</p>
               <p>It is hard to hit upon the exact mean wherein lies good, but generally in the denial of things is the more ſafe errour; in ſome it is Duty. <hi>John had his Raiment of Camels-Hair and a Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern-Girdle about his Loyns, and his Meat was Locuſt and Wild-Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,</hi> Mat. 3. 4. <hi>The Son of Man came Eating and Drinking,</hi> Mat. 11. 19. God is glorified both ways, but the latter is our Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Who hath left direction concerning Faſting, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 16, 17, 18. And a ſtanding Precept againſt Intemperance at any time, <hi>Luke</hi> 21. 34. But though that macerating the Body hath made ſuch a mighty noiſe in Religion as a great meritorious Act; yet ſo much ſtreſs is not to be laid thereon, either by Command or Example from Gods Word. In the old Teſtament there is little or no mention made thereof by way of Command or Duty. In the Goſpel little is ſaid, unleſs <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 5. which is in order to abſtain from other Sins, and if that may be done without, the Reaſon of the Precept ceaſes. And ſo of 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 27. The Body may be kept under and brought into ſubjection without ſo much pining or ſtarving thereof. The Apoſtle ſaith verſe 25. <hi>Every one that ſtriveth for the maſtery is temperate in all things,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luding to thoſe who did Dyet themſelves for the <hi>Olympick</hi> Games: Which plainly implies, that we are to manage our ſelves ſo as to be more fit for the Service of God, and that we may get to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. Now it is evident, we can better ſerve him in Health then in Sickneſs; and it is more accepted when done with a willing good Heart. If we may be ſtill ſpiritual minded, not taking off our Affections from God and the things above, to ſet them on ſmall and periſhing comforts; If we can avoid Sin without ſo much rigour, If we ſet a part ſome time for Faſting and Prayer; I know not what mean thoſe harſh diſciplines, that famiſhing all the Life long; for it is not a ſhriveled skin nor pale looks, nor
<pb n="586" facs="tcp:46484:280"/> a lean Carkaſe which commends unto God; but <hi>A broken and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trite Spirit,</hi> a Soul little in its own eſteem, contracted and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come in intire ſubjection unto him which hath the Body under, and both in obedience unto God. That extream Mortification hath been turned into a groſs miſtake and Superſtition: The cruel afflicting ones ſelf comes near to the <hi>Prophets of</hi> Baal, <hi>who cut themſelves after their manner with Knives and Lances till the Blood guſhed out upon them,</hi> 1 Kings 18. 28 ſo are the ſelf-Whippings and Scourgings of <hi>Pagan Chriſtian Rome;</hi> and alike are the ways of the Heathen, and falſe Religions throughout the World. <hi>But the King of</hi> Iſrael <hi>is a merciful King:</hi> He doth not require theſe things at our Hands: <hi>He doth not Afflict willingly, nor Grieve the Children of Men,</hi> Lam. 3. 33. Neither ſhould they do it fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly themſelves. What deſerving is there utterly to refuſe what God doth give? God would have in this place the Humiliation, but in no wiſe the Miſery of his Creatures; He at preſent keeps them off from true and perfect Happineſs, that being reſerved elſewhere; but denies not their Comfort and Refreſhment. He is not now unwilling that we ſhould be Happy, but then we ſhould be ſo puffed up that we would not have him Reign over our Hearts.

                  <hi>The Word of God is a diſcerner of the thoughts and intents of the Heart. Neither is there any Creature that is not manifeſt in his ſight, but all things are naked and open unto the Eyes of him with whom we have to do,</hi> Heb. 4. 12. 13.

Thoſe who are to <hi>diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi> in order to <hi>turn away Iniquity from</hi> Jacob, by laying open the Aggravation and Sinfulneſs thereof, may by a malicious Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation be thought like him that <hi>accuſes our Brethren before God day and night:</hi> But then this Charge would fall upon the Prophets, Chriſt and Apoſtles, and all faithful Teachers. The caſe ſtands thus, Every Mans final condition is to be determined by God and his own Heart: He knoweth all things, and that knoweth its own Sin. 'Tis the motions of that which commit the evil: And thoſe who are to convince of Sin, are to reprove and not to be our Judges; to Warn, but not to Condemn; If the thing be ſo, they muſt repent and amend; if not, they only admoniſh and exhort to take heed, and there is no harm done. They enjoyn no Duties, but ſet up the Mark again which was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt fallen, to direct in the Way to Heaven; They make no Sins, but raiſe up the float which was ſinking, to keep people from Shipwrack and Periſhing. The great Policy of the Deceiver of mankind is to bring them off from God, to loſe their Knowledge of him, and the Sence of Good and Evil; whereas on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary it hath been the Buſineſs of all true Meſſengers ſent from him, to <note n="†" place="margin">Iſa. 58. 12.</note> reſtore both as much as they could. The leſs Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and particular Examination of their ways, the leſs convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Sin there is, be ſure no ripping of it up from the bottom; the generality of the World think ſo much the better. <hi>For ever, O Lord, thy Word is ſettled in Heaven,</hi> Pſal. 119. 89.

They may be of the ſame Faſhion with others, but more modeſt and leſs expenſive. Not ſetting themſelves out in the ſame manner as the vain Women do of like Rank and Quality. What is ſaved this way and given to the Poor, will avail more then <hi>Conforming to this World,</hi> and the empty applauſe of their Acquaintance. Though people are ſo admired or envied for fine Clothes, yet the principal delight ariſes to the owners from this ignorant mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable nature of lookers on. Good God! that the Soul which was deſigned for great things ſhould ever be brought ſo narrow and low, as to take pleaſure in bodily Veſtments! That ſhe who is brighter then the Sun, if ſhe knew her ſelf, ſhould at alL mind the glittering of Gold or Embroidery! That ſhe whom the whole World cannot ſatisfie in her due ſtretching forth, ſhould ſeem the leaſt contented with what is meer outſide and colour. She muſt be extreamly fallen from her noble and exalted Nature. She muſt loſe much of her original Honour, before ſhe can ſet any eſtimation on them, which are only uſeful and convenient for the Body, but not worthy of her Care and Affection.</p>
               <p>Temperance extends yet further to Recreations: The neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of them appears in that we are Fleſh and not Spirit, that <note place="margin">Of Recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations.</note> will tire and grow weary. It is as needful to Refreſh as to Eat when Hungry. We do not read that Chriſt uſed Recreations, his Meat and Drink was to do the Will of God; But we are not as he was, without Sin and Corruption. We cannot be always converſant about holy things; an Intermiſſion and Freedom is allowed as appears by bodily labour God hath Ordained, and when tired by that he affords Divertiſment. Provided, that we do not ſhut out the ſence of him from Worldly buſineſs, or deny our Subjection unto him in thoſe Portions of Good he hath given. <hi>Be thou in the Fear of the Lord all the day long,</hi> and then do what thy hands find to do: If we acknowledge and preſerve our O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience unto him, and then delight our ſelves as much as we will. Looking unto the end and deſign of a thing, which in Recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is to fit us the more for his Service, and works of our Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling; And therefore are not to be made an occaſion to turn our Hearts from him, or neglect the other. It is lent to refreſh, and
<pb n="590" facs="tcp:46484:282"/> not to fill; to delight, but not to ſatisfie; to uſe, but not to reſt in them; <hi>We are not to be happy before our time.</hi> Even this may be learnt out of the nature of Recreations, for they are hungry and empty; and when immoderately purſued, they are weariſome and ceaſe to Recreate. They pleaſe and divert when ſparingly uſed, but ſtill are not found an adequate Happineſs to Man. That irkſomneſs and not ſatisfying, that conſtant ſeeking after variety though little to be had, not being contented even when one is ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with them, make known all this. Can Men feed on ſtill and be nouriſhed with Sauce only? Theſe do not gratifie the Soul otherwiſe then by rendring the Body more fit for her operations, which cannot be always working: Now what diverts, makes them to ſtand ſtill; but when ſhe is ſomewhat eaſed and relieved, ſhe hath an inclination to return to her proper Employment, and hath regret to be hindred. Happineſs is the end that ſhe drives at, which is kept in another World, we being only to prepare for it here in that method and way God hath Ordained. In our courſe we are aſſaulted by many Temptations and propoſals of Good, which would deceive and turn aſide, <hi>God ſaw every thing be made, and behold it was good,</hi> Gen. 1. 31. Every thing that is not expreſly forbidden, may be lawfully uſed; but an intermixture of evil came in afterwards, ſo it may be turned and abuſed. If Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creations are had according to the preſcribed limits of Moderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they help to our Comfort there and Happineſs hereafter; but if exceſſively dwelt on, they tend to Diſtraction and Miſery. The great danger of them is that then they hinder the Love of God, make to forget him, render us earthly-minded and quite eſtranged from ſpiritual things, they conſume precious time which ſhould be ſpent in working out our Salvation, and doing good to others. The faculties of Soul are not exerciſed on thoſe great and ſutable Objects to which they were deſigned, but are taken up with little and vain things. Had we been only made for them to skip like Lambs, or with the <hi>Leviathan</hi> to take his Paſtime in the deep, the ſame and ordinary endowments which they have, would have ſerved us alſo. There would have been need of no more then power juſt to ſport and play; Reaſon might have been ſpared, and the other Accompliſhments of a Man. We may obſerve in the lower rank of Creatures after the briskneſs and feſtivities of Youth are over, they do not

Here is the Right and the Wrong, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing he muſt do: and if he miſtakes to the latter, there is Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret and Diſcontent. Even when he is exerciſed about vain and inſignificant things, which muſt be done rather then none at all; or if about more material, in which there is ſome but little profit; yet ſtill he knows he is not in his proper work. The uſual ſcene of Employment lies in Recreations and buſineſs of Life; the firſt doth not ſo much ſatisfie the mind as the other, and this doth it not altogether, for there is ſomething further which is ſo little regarded becauſe wilfully ſhut out of the mind, and through the Craft of the Adverſary, theſe are made an occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to ſtifle it, or to divert ſo much from it as ſhould be done. To ſpeak plainly it is <hi>God and Religion,</hi> To ſeek after and know him, to conform to his whole Will, This <hi>O Man is what thou haſt to do;</hi> and all other things which come not under here, are avoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from the <hi>one thing needful.</hi> Said our Lord and Fore-runner, <hi>I muſt work the Work of him that ſent me while it is day: the night cometh when no Man can work,</hi> John 9. 4. His was laying the Foundation for all to build on. He finiſhed the Work God gave him to do, and every Soul is to work out that which he hath wrought and accompliſhed for us all in this Life, which is the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted time; for the darkneſs draws on, in which nothing of this is to be done. And therefore if we neglect, <hi>Wo unto us, for the day goeth away, for the Shadows of the evening are ſtretched out,</hi> Jer. 6. 4. We haſte on towards the Period, ſo uncertain is our ſtay here, that the Sun ſets while it is Noon-day, yea at all times, ſo we are to be as thoſe which wait for the coming of the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom, not knowing when it will be.</p>
               <p>Time was given us that we might prepare for Eternity: It ſeems to point forth the other, as alſo we may know ſomewhat of our own frame. We have immortal Spirits which began to
<pb n="592" facs="tcp:46484:283"/> be, but ſhall never end; for if we look back upon Eternity, that vaſt ſpace which was before we came into the World, we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſounded: We that came forth in time cannot imagine that which was from Everlaſting; but who have aſſurance of continuing for evermore, We can very well conceive what ſhall be to Everlaſting and ſhall have no end. Now Time ſtands between both theſe, as a little Creek between two Seas. And this may be conſidered in the motion of the Celeſtial Bodies ſince they have been Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted until they ſhall be diſſolved: And then Time is that ſpace du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring thoſe ſeveral Generations come and paſs through here as God hath ordained. But to bring it more cloſe to our ſelves, it may be taken for that while every particular Man is in the World. One is more to himſelf then all the World beſides; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is not ſo much concerned with others, or the days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and after, but whilſt himſelf is here, that is his Time. Whilſt he is in Life, the Springs and Wheels thereof continue in moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; ſo that if <hi>the Sun ſhould ſtand ſtill,</hi> yet unleſs the hour-Glaſs within did ceaſe to run, the Garments of Fleſh wax old, it would be no advantage to Man; for the moving of thoſe things with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in determine his ſpace, and not the common meaſure of Days and Nights, Months and Years. Since the World began it was never heard that they did ſtand ſtill with any Man, but the Pulſe is continually beating towards its laſt ſtroke. <hi>We all do fade as a Leaf,</hi> Iſa. 64. 6. When it firſt ſprings and buds forth, it haſtes towards being blown off, or withering, and ſo dropping down. <hi>My times are in thy Hand,</hi> Pſal. 31. 15. during the while God ſhall hold our Souls in life, and the Tabernacle remain fit for our Habitation.</p>

               <p>Haſt thou (courteous Reader) a warm and ſerious Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of this thing? When thou art preſſed with the tediouſneſs of Time, think upon Eternity; And then knoweſt thou not how to make uſe of the flying Moments before thee?

Only a ſpare Minute and the refuſe of Time will this ſerve to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards obtaining that, to which Millions of Years are but the twinkling of an Eye?

Sin, Idleneſs and Covetouſneſs beguile Men of their precious Time; for thus it irrecoverably glides from them without bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, and for all theſe things God will bring them to Judgment. Yea, thoſe which ſeem more ſignificative, in which conſidered ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtractedly there is no ill as ingenuous Arts, unneceſſary Learning and ſeveral other things may be uſed as Recreations only; but if inſiſted on, they are ſomething beſides the matter in hand, and at laſt tend to nothing but to further the great loſs. It would appear ſo whilſt the Man was in the midſt thereof, if he did not
<pb n="694" facs="tcp:46484:284"/> go on in a blind hurry and inconſideration, but it will be plainly diſcerned towards, and at the concluſion. <hi>I have ſeen an end of all Perfection, but thy Commandment is exceeding broad,</hi> Pſal. 119. 96. Nothing remains in a Man, beſides what he doth in the Service of God and for the good of his own Soul. That the Body is a conſuming, but the other part a more enduring ſubſtance may be a little ſeen by this; becauſe all Acts done as to the firſt, do juſt ſerve the preſent end and then utterly periſh; they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined with the day whatever is done in order thereto, yeſterdays Eating and Drinking doth not ſatisfie preſent Hunger. But the Soul is even now bettered and improved for what ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ſome years ago. <hi>The incorruptible Seed of the VVord</hi> ſprings up that was ſown long ſince; and though immediately at firſt it may ſeem buried, it will riſe up and bear Fruit to everlaſting Life. This is the proper and adequate thing for her Spiritual and Immortal nature. <hi>The words of Eternal Life</hi> make her increaſe, whilſt the Fleſh decreaſes. <hi>He that hath my VVord, let him ſpeak my VVord faithfully: what is the Chaff to the VVheat? ſaith the Lord,</hi> Jer. 23. 28. Even now the difference may be perceived, for the one doth not nouriſh like the other; this abides for ever, when that ſhall be utterly blown away.</p>
               <p>Examine all the Actions and Deſigns of Men of whatever Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and great Reputation they may bear in the World; though many are long in compaſſing, yet the ſeveral intermedial Acts paſs away like the trace of a Cloud. When the end is obtained, it is little, unſatisfactory and periſhing; and at length as they might have been put in mind by ſo many little Deaths foregoing, Death comes indeed, and there is an utter end of all they have done, which avails nothing at all. But the buſineſs of Religion all the Life long is Firm and Stedfaſt, Real and Conſtant, there is a ſenſible growth in Grace and Knowledge, a renewal of the inward Man day by day, a building up in our moſt holy Faith, a laying in a Foundation againſt the time to come by good Works; And at laſt it ends in Peace according as the Scriptures ſpeak, which being found true, is an earneſt and aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance that it is finiſhed in Glory. I humbly conceive, God there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore put ſuch a vain and tranſitory Nature in whatever is here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that Man might the more lay hold on this ſubſtantial and enduring thing. <hi>For who knoweth what is good for Man in this life all the days of his vain Life, which he ſpendeth as a ſhadow?</hi> Eccleſ. 6. 12.
<pb n="595" facs="tcp:46484:284"/> Nothing but the <hi>fear of God and keeping his Commandments,</hi> as he concludes the whole, Eccleſ. 12. 13.

Time in it ſelf always paſſes with a certain and equal ſpace, but idleneſs makes moſt to think thereon, and ſo it ſeems to delay.

               <p>TO bring people out of the wrong and miſtaken Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of things, to help ſomewhat towards their Good, it will be neceſſary to explain what Courage is, and how it promotes their Happineſs. Many excellent things have we heard of this Vertue, but ſtill as to the particular nature thereof moſt are ignorant, Extolling they know not what, they know not wherefore. Neither ſhall the due eſtimation thereof be leſſened, ſo it be juſtly ſtated as it is for the ſecurity and well-being of Mankind; for even this Temptation the Deſtroyer makes uſe of to inſnare and beguile Souls unto himſelf. They are taken with nothing ſo much as what looks great, To deſpiſe Evil and laugh at Fear, not to value their own Lives, to run on with a certain blindneſs and hurry towards the land of Darkneſs. Not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the worſt things that befall the Sons of Men, or threaten afar off; all this he hath gotten to paſs for Courage and Magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimity in the World. And Thouſands deluded with this falſe Imagination of things come to <hi>dye as Fools.</hi> They did not mind the things that were told them, as a Man is Cheated of himſelf, ſo are they who ſo paſs through this World, as if certainly there was an end of them and no more. Their doings turn upon this Point, Whether there be an Immortality and Reſurrection. Which themſelves do not abſolutely disbelieve, but not examine nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider of. What vaſt Multitudes have been cut off before their Time, by Engaging themſelves in unneceſſary Wars, Duels, Reveng<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, and many more by the murdering Sins of Gluttony, Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and uncleanneſs. All theſe make a ſhew of Courage. Tuſh they are not afraid of Death, or what may be afterwards. They
<pb n="603" facs="tcp:46484:288"/> would not ſeem concerned for theſe things. This their way is eſteemed Gallantry of Spirit, a Noble Reſolution, a Worthy Temper: But what if upon the ſtrict ſcrutiny it ſhould appear to be Folly and Madneſs? ſtrip them of their Armour and Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liments of War, look underneath, and we ſhall ſee a dull incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderate Soul under the Vizour of Courage.</p>
               <p>That properly conſiſts in the middle between Fear and Bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, for it is Miſerable and fooliſh to fear where no Fear is, it is often an hindrance and keeps off from obtaining Good, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore true Reſolution drives away all this; ſo on the other hand, to thruſt ones ſelf upon Evils is meer raſhneſs, for it proceeds from Ignorance and Inconſideration of them, and that is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible Boldneſs, like the Horſe they ride on <hi>to ruſh into the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle;</hi> Or if they have a little fore-ſight, and will dare on through Pride of Heart, this is Folly. In every thing a Wiſe Man takes in Hand, He firſt debates, Whether the Good he ſhall gain, will be greater and weigh down the Evil he ſhall ſubject himſelf unto? Whether the talking Breath of others which perhaps he hears not, or if he doth, would but ſlightly affect him, yet this will not make amends for ſenſible and laſting Pain. Or if he goes further to give up his Life, Is it prudence by having not made preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on before (as commonly ſuch is the caſe of thoſe we ſpeak of) to plunge themſelves into that dreadful uncertainty of the other World for a light and ſhort Commendation in this? and here they will be forgotten, but their Souls will be ſtill mindful, and it may be with Anguiſh Condemn them there, for what they ſought to be applanded in this.</p>
               <p>This Argument is to be applyed to thoſe who erect wrong Principles of Action, to prevent Mens making themſelves Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable; but when they are ſet aright as in Obedience to God, or comprehended under that, in Duty to the King, this ſame will turn on the other ſide; for there the promiſed and aſſured Good is much greater then the Evil expoſed unto, as may be ſurther ſhewed anon. If there may be leſs Lye and more Truth, that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Creatures may not be deceived with a Shadow and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance only, but lay hold of the real Happineſs: That fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going the falſe, they may learn the true Courage. Unleſs it be guided by Wiſdom it brings no Good, but Harm unto Men. Some Imagine theſe ſtand in oppoſition; A Wiſe Man is ſeldom

               <p>But if we conſider that Eſtabliſhment and Diſpoſal of things God hath fixed, how they are exactly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>itted for this Life of Tryal and future Reward, there is a Wiſe and Wonderful agreement and connexion of them all. Pleaſure and Pain are the two Hinges on which all our Actions turn. God, <hi>Whoſe Thoughts are not as our Thoughts,</hi> takes a contrary method to be glorified in his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, by requiring them to go againſt what they are common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inclined unto. His Commandments are made up of Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and Poſitive, what he forbids, and what he enjoyns: In the firſt is a ſemblance of Pleaſure, and that is to be reſiſted; in the other is a ſhew of Irkſomneſs and Evil, which is to be choſen and got over. Here is the exerciſe of our Courage, for it is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the keeping of the Commandments. <hi>Be ye therefore very Couragious to keep and to do all that is written in the Law of</hi> Moſes, <hi>that ye turn not aſide therefrom to the right hand or to the left,</hi> Joſh. 23. 6. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

It is more ſatisfaction to reſiſt then to yield unto a ſoft Temptation, for to that ſucceeds Repentance and Vexation; but for what looks uncouth and frightful, yet reſolutely to grapple therewith, and ſubdue it, there follows a Bleſſed Approbation and Complacency of Soul.

               <p>How ſtrange are the exceſſes and runnings out of Pride! The nature of Man doth not lie ſluggiſh, for if it doth not grow up the right way in Knowledge and Obedience, it will ſhoot and ſp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we are in the common nature of Man, or however placed in thoſe different Ranks in the World, yet Humility requires to do any thing at his Command, to obſerve every title of our Duty nevertheleſs, and alſo a right Carriage to our Brethren of poor and low eſtate. We are required to do things not properly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath or diſgraceful to our nature, for nothing is ſo in the moſt ſubmiſſive Acts of Religion, but what looks little and contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible in the Eye of others; On the contrary, to deſpiſe thoſe <hi>things which are highly eſteemed amongſt Men;</hi> Not to affect or run greedily after them, for this would be to give an implied prefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to them before the things of God.</p>
               <p>Pride is an appearing above what one is in himſelf, and diſcovers it ſelf in Diſobedience to God, and lifting up above the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren. It is ſet down in Scripture by <hi>lifting up and exalting,</hi> 2 Chron. 26. 16. Jer. 48. 29. Jer. 49. 16. 1 Sam. 2. 3. Iſa. 2. 11, 12. Iſa. 13. 11. Iſa. 14. 14. Ezek. 28. 2. Dan.

Rom. 12. 3. <hi>A thinking himſelf above what he ought,</hi> a being puffed up with what he hath not, or ſetting too great a value on what he hath, or concluding them to be his own which he hath received. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is contrary to that juſt true Knowledge and Eſteem of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, is Pride. And this is not to be meaſured according to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of others, but the reality of things. Humility and Pride branch forth into two ſeveral Principles of Action; Which is the more worthy and likely to tend unto Happineſs will be proper for preſent enquiry; and let us not judge by the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of one ſide or fewneſs of the other, but from the Truth and Reaſon of things.</p>
               <p>Humility at firſt ſeems Sneaking and Contemptible; Which was not ſo much known before Religion came into the World. But this hath been ſaid to unman us, making us to ſtoop and preſs down to the Earth. Some think thoſe Proſtrations and humble Geſtures in Divine Service unbecoming the erected Stature of Man; Neither is it for him to be curbed and reſtrained in his way. To fore-go thoſe great things of the World, and have a mean opinion of himſelf, as if he did not underſtand or know; all theſe are not ſutable with the lofty nature of Man.</p>
               <p>Such are the firſt and ſudden Apprehenſions, but not a full and ſerious Thought. It cannot be the leaſt undervaluing for <hi>Man whoſe Breath is in his Noſtrils,</hi> within a little compaſs, to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject unto him, <hi>whoſe Spirit filleth the World.</hi> It is meet and right that the <hi>Knees ſhall bow and bend</hi> to him, who made them thus <note place="margin">Pſal. 95. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>Flexible.</hi> It is the greateſt Honour that can poſſibly be to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, that ſo Glorious a God doth vouchſafe any relation to us: He is moſt worthy of our Obedience and Service. Doth any one <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

It is ſeemly for a Worm to lie proſtrate before the Lord and Governour of the World, to whom Angels and Arch-Angels cover themſelves, and fall on their Faces. It <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>is reaſonable to give up our will to his Will; It was thy own will and power at firſt God having left it ſo, and he is <hi>willingly</hi> obedient unto his Maker. What he hath choſen is a Law of Liberty &amp; Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency; the particular Acts are as worthy, and rather to be followed then thoſe of a Mans own Invention and Fancy. He is a Servant to God but none elſe, neither the Devil, nor Luſt, nor other Men; And therefore is more Honourable then thoſe who have them for
<pb n="620" facs="tcp:46484:297"/> their-Maſters, as all have one or the other. For his ſtupidity and narrowneſs of mind in not caring for the things of this World, will the Men here of joyn lſſue upon this Point, and try whoſe Soul is moſt enlarged and hath the more noble deſires? The one ſeeks for the <hi>great things of God and Eternity,</hi> the Glories of his Kingdom, that moſt perfect exceeding and enduring Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, yea, every thing ſo vaſt and Wonderful, that the Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to U<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But it is eaſily beaten back again; for we may well judge of the Greatneſs of the things which are not ſeen, by the Greatneſs of them which are ſeen. How we ſhall come at them we may thus know, The ſame power who ſent us hither, will convey us up; and alſo the pure and holy Soul freed from Sin and Earth-Iineſs, hath ſuch Aſpirings and Flyings up, that ſhe would even now break out unleſs kept in by theſe Chains of Fleſh; but when the <hi>Angel ſhall come and they fall off,</hi> then ſhe immediately <note place="margin">Acts 12. 7.</note> aſcends towards thoſe High and Bleſſed Manſions. Is this preſſing down to the Earth, or exalting up to Heaven? Who now willingly fall down, that they may riſe up again. <hi>Humble your ſelves in the ſight of the Lord, and he ſhall lift you up,</hi> Jam. 4. 10. They chooſe to be deſpiſed in honouring of him, that he may. Honour them Humility is a great help in the ſeveral acts of Obedience, and enables to reſiſt Temptations. It renounces lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and preſent things in order to the future, which are ſo exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that it is not poſſible to utter.

That gives Peace and Quietneſs, Contentment and Satisfaction, Moderates our deſires as to Temporal things. The humble Perſon acknowledges to have received every thing he hath, and is far from Glorying as if he had not received it, ſo likewiſe from Murmuring if not given; for he can with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold his Hand, and who may find fault? There is not ſo very much (God having been pleaſed thus to order it for wiſe and good ends) in thoſe Bleſſings of his left Hand; ſufficient indeed to excite our Thankfulneſs, but not to place our Happineſs in; ſo neither to Fret or make our ſelves Miſerable for want of them. A lowly frame of mind brings Good and Comfort in every ſtate

               <p>When a Man doth not ſeek for that Happineſs which cometh <note place="margin">Of Pride</note> from God only, he will endeavour to build up one to himſelf, to Advance and become as Great as he can, by all manner of means, without Reſpect had to the Divine Commandments. And this either in the improvement of what he hath already, or looking out and labouring after more. There is a Conſciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his imperfection by Nature, how ſmall and of no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, How Mean and Poor a Being he is, and a ſecret Vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation thereat; whereupon he is reſolved to redreſs this as much as lieth in his power. And indeed if he would go in Gods Way, he were to be commended herein; for he made us ſo low in order to Exaltation, that by complying with his Grace we ſhould be brought unto Glory, by following of him we ſhould aſcend higher; but alas! we for ſake him and will <hi>go in our own way, according to our own thoughts.</hi> The reaſon of our miſtake <note place="margin">Pſal. 73, 5 6.</note> is, becauſe there is no preſent and viſible Increaſe in the one, whilſt there doth ſeem to be in the other. But as our Lord ſaid of thoſe who did their Religious Duties for the Glory of Men. <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily they have their Reward,</hi> Mat. 6. 2. So it holds true of all Sin, Luſt, Stubbornneſs and Humour, and more eſpecially of all manner of Pride. It hath the preſent Conveniency and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed Good only, but no more, As here getting Honour and preventing Contempt, or ſuch like. Now if theſe do not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to ſo much as the probable Good of the other way, a wiſe Man knoweth what he hath to do and chooſe. We are aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured what is the utmoſt of Pride or worldly Greatneſs in Men or things; and ſee whether they are worthy to be compared with <hi>Angels, Saints</hi> or thoſe <hi>Glorious things that are ſpoken of thee, thou City of God;</hi> this will manifeſt who ſets before him the more Honourable end.</p>
               <p>I have often admired what the Pſalmiſt ſaith, <hi>The Wicked through the Pride of his Countenance will not ſeek after God,</hi> Pſal. 10. 4. When it is verified by Experience at this day: Religion is a little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible thing, it is for the lower ſort of People to mind that, but ſome fancy themſelves above it; Whereas if they had but ſo much
<pb n="622" facs="tcp:46484:298"/> Wit and Reaſon as to make an Inference, they might conclude, As ſure as the Object thereof is R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But come to debate the Caſe ye Sons of Pride. Are not your ways little? your great Company are but Men and Women, who <hi>alſo are ſormed out of the Clay,</hi> Job 33. 6. Are not thoſe Honourable Titles a meer <hi>Voice,</hi> which have their being only upon the Breath of the Speaker, and are nothing beſides? What are fine Clothes, Gayety and Retinue? Not ſo much when compared with the Dazling of <hi>Seraphims,</hi> as the paint of a Butterflie to the Sun. What are a few little Creatures going together, when conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with the <hi>innumerable company of Angels,</hi> one whereof is greater in Power and Might then an Hundred Fourſcore Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand of us? Behold all the Kingdoms of the World, and the Glory of them; they are not diſperſed throughout the Earth, but compriſed in a leſſer Part, one City in a Nation, and within a few Houſes. But what is that taken in with the whole together? <hi>Lift up your Eyes on high, and behold who hath Created theſe things,</hi> lſa. 40. 26. And then determine which is greateſt. Open the Doors of your Underſtanding that the whole may come in; and then conceive who is more Honourable, The Servant of him whoſe is the World and the Fulneſs thereof, or a Lord of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Acres of Land. Thoſe Palaces and great Houſes are not ſo much as the Dwelling of Ants to that <hi>Habitation of his Holineſs, the Houſe Eternal in the Heavens</hi> prepared for all thoſe who dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently ſeek to come there.

               <p>This doth ſhew forth the great and enlarged faculties in Man that can ſtretch thus far; but again this betrays his Degeneracy and Folly, that he ſhould do it upon ſuch a ſmall and light occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

For him that is called unto Precious and Ineſtimable things, to Pride himſelf in thoſe of no value, to be liſted up with meer Vanities when they are capable to inherit great Excellencies; which they ſet at naught, becauſe they underſtand them not. It will be the Exclamation at laſt, What hath Pride profited us, or what good hath Riches brought us? But this voice ſignifies no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="624" facs="tcp:46484:299"/> to Men in Deſperation and Miſery. Whereas if now they would <hi>lay it to Heart,</hi> it might bring them out of this Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Snare of the Devil.

Even in this doubt where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the World ſtands divided, One that hath common Wiſdom and diſcerning in every Action he takes in Hand, or in every thing he propoſes to himſelf, might reduce it all this. Whether the good or evil of a thing will be greater, conſidering both what is preſent and what is to come, for this will as certainly be here as the other: And this ſhould determine every ones choice in the way to Happineſs, which indeed muſt, if he would make ſure and not be deceived therein. <hi>We call the Proud Happy,</hi> Mal. 3. 15. Mark the Phraſe, for it is only ſo with word of Mouth, but we cannot conclude it ſo upon Conſideration and Diſcourſe; for that will make to appear, it brings more Evil then Good unto Men.</p>
               <p>It is the cauſe of Diſobedience unto God, for it fooliſhly diſdaines to be in ſubjection unto him, and prefers its own will before the Will of God. This is a very great temptation, for tis not ſo much the Pleaſures of a Wicked Life, but a Proud thinking to have the alone Command over himſelf and his own Actions, to be governed by none, and who ſhall controul him? This makes to ſlight and ſeem to laugh at the Word of God; They reckon it a piece of Bravery that they can do contrary, They deſpiſe the means of Grace and Salvation, They piſh at Inſtruction, and thoſe who are appointed to make it known. Shall a few Men take up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them to be Wiſer then the reſt, or to Reform others, or ſhall they do according as they are bid? But all this is eaſily anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for God fpeaks unto the World by thoſe of the ſame like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with our ſelves; it is nothing to us let Men do as they will, no more then it is to the Poſte whether the Proclamation be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed withal or not. <hi>His Laws are ſet before us by his Servants the Prophets,</hi> Dan. 9. 10.

And thoſe who purpoſely go againſt thoſe Pillars of Truth, will find that they had better run their Head a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a ſtone-Wall, which may daſh out their own Brains, but that remains unſhaken. But the Proud Men will not hear nor read, or if they do, they will not obey; for ſay they in the deep of the Heart, they have power over themſelves, which is the beginning of their Diſobedience and Tranſgreſſion, they are lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the Miſery and Threatning annexed, which will certainly come upon them if they continue in that wicked mind. The Stubbornneſs and Contempt is much worſe to the great God over all, then if a Son or a Servant is perverſly reſolved not to † hear <note place="margin">Jer. 13. 15.</note> and know what his Father or Maſter would ſay, or not give heed to it. All Men are not thus abominably Wicked; but this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed thing of Pride hinders others from obeying the whole Will of God, and ſo keeps them off from peace of Mind, and deprives of that future recompence which is to thoſe who <hi>love the Lord with all their Heart and all their Soul,</hi> for there is a reſerve of ſome Sin, or omiſſion of ſome Duty, becauſe they would not loſe their Reputation amongſt Men.

Wherefore Humble your ſelves O ye Mighty, for this is the way to preſerve what you have, and attain greater Advancement.

               <p>Man would be Happy and Great his own way, and that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently; God hath ordered another, which is to be begun here and fully manifeſted hereafter.

Thence cometh ſpiritual Pride to be the greateſt of all Pride, as thoſe Graces and Gifts are more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent then any thing whatſoever. But that <hi>all Glory may be unto God,</hi> for ſtirring up Thankfulneſs unto him, and quelling Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceit, and alſo to take ſomewhat off from the Temptation to Hypocriſie; it may be requiſite to lay open this Propoſition with the Reaſons thereof, <hi>viz.</hi> If a Man be Religious, he deſerves not the leaſt Praiſe nor Reputation from others; for it is matter of Duty as he is a Servant; If he is only according to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Standard of the World, that is from a mercenary ſelfiſh prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple out of reſpect to the promiſe of Eternal Life, and fear of the threatnings of Eternal Death, and that prudential ſecurity to ſaving of the Soul as to the uncertainty thereof.

He generally gives that firſt, the flouriſhing and light ſomeneſs of Youth, when they are capable of knowing him; So when they grow up further if they continue in his Obedience, he turns the Mirth of that into a more ſolid Joy and Peace. He manifeſts his goodneſs becauſe he makes this the firſt Experiment, and doth not <hi>Afflict willingly</hi> unleſs Mercy and Juſtice do require it. <hi>But he giveth more Grace, wherefore he ſaith, God reſiſteth the Proud, but gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth Grace to the Humble.</hi> James 4. 6. If they are Humble ſtill, he will yet increaſe that, for he would give exceeding gifts unto Men, if they would not be lifted up; but when they are, he hinders or takes a way the qualifications wherein they boaſt, or ſome way de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feats them. So here as long as their Heart is right and ſtedfaſt in his Covenant, he continues their Tranquillity; but if they turn aſide, ſome Adverſity is laid on them. Theſe two are the ſame unto the Body and Eſtate, as Love and Fear to the Soul and inward Man; the firſt is more Generous and Noble, the other proves commonly more attractive. Fear is the beginning of Wiſdom, but Love is the Accompliſhment and Excellency there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. So it may be applyed to Adverſity and Proſperity. He is not a right Chriſtian who doth every thing out of fear, nor yet to whom Affliction is the principal Impulſive; for there are in both an unwillingneſs, and no full ſincere Intention to pleaſe God.

Though we cannot ſee through all, yet we have ſufficient revealed to be moſt fully aſſured, that he is juſt and equal. Here in the place of Faith and Tryal, many things come to paſs of which though we may in general be ſatisfied of the Goodneſs and Juſtice of God in ordering and ſuffering them ſo to be, yet we cannot give ſo particular account how it is ſo in a ſtrict ſence and ſuperlative de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
<pb n="640" facs="tcp:46484:307"/> as moſt certainly it is. This is to be imputed to our blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and want of underſtanding, which ſhall be done away when he comes to judge the Earth. <hi>Judgment will I lay to the Line, and Righteouſneſs to the Plummet,</hi> Iſa. 28. 7. All things ſhall be exactly ſtated at laſt; He is even now Righteous in all his ways, and will give a clear account how he is ſo. The things of this World are now loved and feared, but then it will appear, that there is ſo little in them, that they are not worthy to be ſpoken of or had in Remembrance. However God will not forget any Labour or Pain his Servants endured for him. They ſhall be as a Dream when one awaketh, and who is much concerned for the Pleaſantneſs or Dreadfulneſs thereof, after it is over? Call to mind the days that are paſt, recollect both the Good and Evil of them, or what was done at ſuch a place when you are removed from thence; much more will it be ſo when you are tranſlated from Time to Eternity, from Earth to Heaven. It is ſo meer a nothing, that if the Creature might be bold to ſpeak with his Maker, it will not be inſiſted on or required from Gods Hands, but what he will be pleaſed to do of his own Promiſe and Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; for one would think Juſtice it ſelf is not obliged to make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends for ſmall Matters, when the harm is over, and the very ſame as if it had never been at all. This ſingle Conſideration if throughly weighed, would eaſe our mind in all Afflictions: The Tranſitorineſs of them, as alſo they are vain and little; for however we Groan and Murmur, yet they are ſuch as can be endured. They are not ſo great, as we weak and frail by Nature. We further bring a delicacy and tenderneſs on our ſelves, which makes us yet more unable to bear them. Whereas if we would comply univerſally with his deſign, God would ordain Strength out of our Weakneſs; He would give us that Grace and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, if we were meet to be partakers thereof and make uſe of them, that would carry us through all trouble whatſoever: for he ſuffers none to fall on us but what is common to Men. And how know we but he to manifeſt his own Glory, doth lay the more heavy things on him that ſo weak a thing may endure them, and intend its greater Happineſs by a proportionable Reward? <hi>For I reckon that the Sufferings of this preſent time, are not worthy to be compared with the Glory which ſhall be revealed in us,</hi> Rom. 8. 18.

The matter is eaſily conceivable, unleſs they abſolutely disbelieve or cannot underſtand; for if an Heir of a good Eſtate can contentedly rub through ſome Inconveniencies in the mean while upon proſpect of that, Why may not another do the ſame in hope of Heaven? If one is ſupported by a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Friend, Husband, God reveals himſelf to be ſuch to every one that feareth him, and doth likewiſe uphold.

Doth he who is in purſuit of a great Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage mind the loſs of a Farthing? God who gives Breath and Food, doth alſo give Relief to the Soul.

Words are Thoughts expreſſed, which ariſe from, and are the workings of the mind. Set them aſide, you muſt renounce the very Soul and Reaſon, and confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently Unman him. What do Words ſignifie? So you may ask of Wiſdom, Underſtanding, and all thoſe noble Faculties within, which are diſcovered by them. Take away theſe, Man is a lump of Clay, juſt enlivened, but withall vile and weak: A dumb &amp; breathing Statue without uſe or excellency. More need not be ſaid to lay open the Abſurdity and Monſtrouſneſs of this; All will grant there is need of ſome Speech or Language, and there is more in it then a Voice only, for it is ſignificative of Things as what is commonly ſeen, heard or talked of. Things are viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and inviſible, paſt preſent and future. Now Words convey and make all theſe known, making inviſible to be as it were viſible to us paſt, and future preſent by the deſcription it gives of them. Herein appears the excellency and reality of Words, that they repreſent thoſe things which do not appear, as if they did appear. <hi>Who ſhall aſcend into Heaven? that is to bring down Chriſt from above: Or who ſhall deſcend into the deep? that is to bring up Chriſt again from the Dead.

That ſpeaks of God himſelf, of whom are all things; That declares unto us the aſtoniſhing Works of Creation, The Motion of the Stars, and the Springs of the Deep. Which comprehend in one Sentence the Compaſs of the World and all that is therein. This we ſee done with our Eyes in Ink and Paper, we hear it with our Ears in a light and aiery ſound, Of what we are further convinced without by the Eye of Sence.

The Will of God is as we learn from <hi>John 1. 6, 7. That all Men through him might believe.</hi> So we read <hi>Acts</hi> 28. 24, that at the firſt time of Hearing, <hi>Some believed the things that were ſpoken, and ſome believed not.</hi> But would they have attended again and again for ſucceſſive times, hearkened to what might be urged fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, then more might have believed. Did ever any Man feriouſly underſtand and throughly weigh all the Arguments that might be brought for Faith, and yet remain an Unbeliever? It is poſſible through Prejudice, Ignorance, hardneſs of Heart; but not to a ſincere and willing mind, that hath no other end but to be ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, whether indeed theſe things are ſo? The greater part will
<pb n="645" facs="tcp:46484:309"/> not admit of a full hearing, leaſt they ſhould believe and be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and ſo they are of their own fault Unbelievers. That place in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6. 9, 10. is after God hath uſed former Methods, as appears by his Expoſtulation in the foregoing Chapter, <hi>What could I have done more for my Vineyard that I have not done in it?</hi> Iſa. 5. 4.

               <p>All the Affairs of this World, The Government of King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, Tranſactions of Parliament, Proceedings at common Law, Adminiſtration of Phyſick are founded upon certain Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions; There are Rules and Skill as to inferiour Trades, which are known by Thought &amp; Obſervation; and ſo all the other Actions of Mankind, both good and bad, are the reſult of forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Thoughts, which either are or might be made known by Words; and therefore, Whv ſhould this be an Objection to Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, which is to nothing beſides?

Yet the Wiſdom of God fore-ſeeing this Deceit doth ſo often caution a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it. Nothing is more common in theſe days then the work done, going to Church and there is an end. But what is written in Gods Book, and done in his Worſhip, every leaſt Syllable and part thereof is ſignificative. And who doth not think or do thereafter that Mans Religion is Vain, and he is to <hi>have his Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with Hypocrites and unbelievers.</hi> Here is alſo a Leſſon for thoſe who inſtruct others, <hi>Who ſay and do not,</hi> Mat. 23. 3. <hi>Thou which Teacheſt another, Teacheſt thou not thy ſelf?</hi> Rom 2. 21.

               <p>It may be ſeen by this time, that the Man whoſe <hi>Trade is of Words,</hi> is as honourable and neceſſary as any. And though he doth ſpeak of another World, that is not Vain, for it is the leaſt part of the World where we Inhabit. It is not another World, but another part of the World as a Room of an Houſe. This is ſeen with our Eyes, and much more to be underſtood by Reaſon and Perſpectives. There is ſomething Above and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing Beneath, whither the Spirit doth go when the Body is laid in the Grave, and that to ariſe again. This conſideration is unpleaſant, and therefore Men are ſhy and afraid of thoſe who put in mind hereof. Whereas we are likewiſe Men ſubject to the ſame things. And why ſhould they refuſe to think of that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-hand which will certainly be? when this fore-thought would render them ſafe if it were throughly given way unto. Mankind need not be in Perplexity, Fear or Stupid Inconſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for there are laid down aſſured Principles how they may be <note place="margin">Heb. 11. 7.</note> Happy, which are impoſſible to fail, for then we muſt be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all. So none need be enraged againſt thoſe as <hi>Tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Earth,</hi> who are Inſtruments of Peace and Safety. On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly let us be Submiſſive and Obedient unto that Mighty One above, and then no Evil can poſſibly happen unto us. <hi>Fear, and the Pit, and the Snare are upon thee, O Inhabitant of the Earth,</hi> Iſa. 24. 17. But there is a way ſhewed how thou mayeſt eſcape and be freed from them all. If thou were left to thy ſelf, or wouldſt go on unmindful, thou wouldſt fall unto them.</p>
               <p>What doth preſerve from the great Danger and Evil, this doth likewiſe adminiſter Relief to the leſſer Griefs of the People. <hi>This is my Comfort in Affliction, for thy VVord hath quickened me,</hi> Pſal. 119. 50. All Affliction (except what ſtrikes upon ſence, as Pain and Sickneſs) is the impreſſion of ſuch ſad and reſenting Thoughts; now what produces of a different kind, as when <hi>Good VVords and Comfortable VVords,</hi> Zech. 1. 13. are received in, they make glad as the other did ſorrowful, There is an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration of the Soul, or the one are ſet againſt the other, and ſo the Vexation is leſs. We often read that <hi>God Comforts,</hi> Iſa. 49. 43. &amp; 51<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

A Mans own fancies plague him, but what he gathers from thence do refreſh him. Let him not run haſtily, but conſider upon every verſe, and when he hath found the <hi>VVord of Conſolation,</hi> let him ſtay and fix thereon.

They are not always, and then is greater anguiſh; but however they muſt all fail at laſt. But what comes from the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of Life, is a ſtream continually running; it gives conſtant Peace and Quietneſs to the Soul, and aſcends up into the Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe of our God where is no Conſolation, for there is no need thereof. Again, Worldly Aid at the very time cannot give true and firm Relief, nor take off from a great Adverſity. <hi>But the Lord is a ſtrong Hold in the day of Trouble, he knoweth them that truſt in him,</hi> Nahum 1. 7. We know not who are Hypocrites, who partial Chriſtains; but who are Sincere and Obedient with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reſerve, who underſtand and can apply the Word of God, they have that Patience and Reſignation, that Complacency and joyful Hope, which the Wicked and Diſſemblers cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend unto. There is a ſenſible difference between good and bad as to the enduring of Affliction; One doth bear up and is truly Couragious under it, when they are faint or ſtupid. Truth is not to be learnt from Examples, for we cannot ſee into, and know all their circumſtances. Whilſt we reflect upon particular inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, we often doubt of Scripture, (for Truth is the ſame in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition and Experience) whereas we ſhould in the firſt place look to what is written, and be aſſured all that is true. It is not for us, but God to judge of every Mans work, he will manifeſt the Counſels of the Heart, and then his Word will be found true by what, and how it is with them. <hi>Thy Word is Truth,</hi> John. 17. 17. bringing Comfort and Happineſs unto Men, but they turn aſide not complying with the terms thereof, neither are they ſuch as that requires them to be.</p>
               <pb n="650" facs="tcp:46484:312"/>
               <p>The deſign of the whole Book of God is to build us up in our moſt holy Faith, which comprehends the Word of Exhortation, for this follows from the other; and to teach truly the way of Salvation, this is Inſtruction; and the reſt is Conſolation, to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry us through the <hi>Wilderneſs that he might humble thee, and that he might prove thee, to do thee good at thy latter end,</hi> Deut. 8. 16. So Happineſs is the end of all. What more can be deſired by Man? Wherefore ſhould he ſet himſelf againſt that, which would do all this? It is becauſe he is not made throughly ſenſible of thus much. Search and try till you find the worth thereof. It is a <hi>hidden Manna which no Man knoweth, ſaving he that receiveth it,</hi> Rev. 2. 17. Hide it in thy Heart, do not only read and get it without Book, but have the ſence thereof within thee, and thou mayeſt come to affirm experimentally with <hi>David, The Law of thy Mouth is better unto me then Thouſands of Gold and Silver,</hi> Pſal. 119. 72. It will conduce more to thine Happineſs then all worldly Conveniencies, for they periſh when here are the <hi>Words of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life;</hi> they do not ſatisfie the Soul as theſe; they cannot keep off Pains and Diſeaſes and Griefs, whereas the Grace and Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ariſing hence prevents them many times, and ſhews the way to the favour of God, who comforteth thoſe that are caſt down, and delivereth <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of all his Troubles, putting ſuch an end to them, that it was better to have had, then to have been without them. In the worſt of Evils they have greater cauſe for Joy then Sorrow. <hi>Bleſſed is the Man that truſteth in the Lord, and whoſe Hope the Lord is: for he ſhall be as a Tree planted by the VVaters, and that ſpreadeth out her Roots by the Rivers, and ſhall not ſee when Heat cometh, but her Leaf ſhall be green, and ſhall not be careful in the Year of Drought, neither ſhall ceaſe from yielding Fruit,</hi> Jer. 17 7, 8.</p>
               <p>The Sayings of Philoſophers and Wiſe Men may a little aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwage ſome kind of Trouble, but are inſufficient to ſupport un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a great and long Adverſity; Whereas the Scriptures afford Hope and Comfort to the greateſt that befall Men. They may alleviate for Inadvertency and Folly, and prevent it in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; the Word doth the ſame, and much more by providing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Evils of corrupt Nature which are the cauſe of all Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row; It doth alſo ſhew a way for what is paſt and unavoidable, and admoniſhes to Sin no more, leaſt worſt things befall us. The
<pb n="651" facs="tcp:46484:312"/> Dictates of Morality and Humane reaſoning may do ſomewhat as to ſelf-Vexation, leſſer injuries and reproaches from others, inconſiderable loſſes and ſuch like; but for the greater Miſeries can find no help as the frailty of Mans Nature, dangerous Diſeaſes, fears of Death, doubtfulneſs of the ſucceeding State, how to ſecure future Happineſs and avoid Miſery. Here the antient Sages are Dumb, and they cannot tell what to ſay. They are in Perplexity and Amazement themſelves, how then ſhould they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult for others? They were lifted up with a conceit of the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit they did unto Mankind, when their Conſolatory diſcourſes could avail only as to thoſe light things which might be laughed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, or Couragiouſly born; Or the wicked Men of our days find remedy againſt by Pots and Company; for if things were ſo as they ſaid, this laſt was a ſure Relief. They might indeed regulate the diſorders of Fancy and Opinion; But for what did really make Men miſerable by ſhaking the Powers of the Soul, what did torment and endanger the Body is by Philoſophers left re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medileſs. They would blunder out ſomething, which was ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous conjecture or uncertainty. As, <hi>What is ſuffered here, would have an end,</hi> which the meereſt Ideot knew as well as they. <hi>None is Happy before Death,</hi> A ſad Conſolation to thoſe who knew not what ſhould be after that; and when they did ſurmize it would be an utter end, how abſurb muſt their Arguing be? As if Man was made only for Miſery, and his utmoſt Happineſs was to be freed from that and be no more for ever. What is more miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in Life, then to be willing to die? To have an impatient de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire after eaſe and Happineſs, but to find none till become with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Sence or Capacity. Some of them did go further as to talk of Immortality and a future State, of this with much doubting; but then they did raiſe the Fears of Mankind, of what ſort it would be, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Happineſs or Miſery. They would ſpeak moſt of Glory, Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and the <hi>Eliſian Fields.</hi> This was inſiſted on as a Mighty word of Conſolation for all the Evils here; But then the miſtake and deluſion was (which conſidering Men did ſpie out and therefore received to aſſurance) even what they were forced to grant when they came to diſcuſs it particularly, that there were two kinds of Futurity, Reward and Puniſhment, and they knew not exactly what Men were to do to obtain the one, what to leave undone to avoid the other. Their Ignorance as to this kept the World in ſuſpence, did raiſe their Horrour and Dread, but not allay it; What they
<pb n="652" facs="tcp:46484:313"/> would have ſuggeſted as a Dellverance from Trouble, they could give no certainty but worſe might abu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Neither is this any Argument againſt Chriſtian Religion, becauſe it happens ſo now: Common People and Women do gladly hear thereof, when Politicians and thoſe who would paſs for Wiſe Men among us, do not ſo much mind it; for this Diverſity is to be obſerved. They of old did ſlight vain Philoſophy, but it was after they had ſearcht its Principles, and found them only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectural and fallacious; whereas the Men of our times contemn our Faith and Practice without Examination, for let them admit this throughly, and then ſpeak lightly thereof if they can. This is the Policy of Satan whereby his Kingdom ſtands, he would not let them try what he beats them from, for if they ſhould, they would not continue with him. This is the difference of Truth and Falſhood, the one appears more true by the Touch Stone, the other falſe. The only Argument againſt Truth is to put it off, the way to reſiſt is to be at a diſtance, and come not near it. Thus <hi>Paganiſm</hi> ſpread and continued of old. Thus Chriſtianity was endeavoured to be ſtifled, and its further increaſe hindred. Here is the reaſon that of old Men did walk in their own ways, and even of thoſe that do ſoat this preſent time. They were willing to be Happy then, and unwilling to be Miſerable, and ſo are now; when they were in Affliction or Trouble, they were willing to be eaſed and delivered, ſo they are now. The Truth was not ſo clearly manifeſted to the greater part of the World. <hi>The times of this Ignorance God winked at,</hi> Acts 17. 30. He made Men of ſuch Faculties and Powers to ſee what they could bring forth, and now he hath given more aſſiſtance by further Revelation, if any thing may be done yet more. God makes Men now as he did from the Beginning, with the ſame Reaſon, Inclinations, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, Fears and Averſations: we who ſtand in theſe latter days on the Earth, wherein iniquity doth abound with more Weakneſs and Sorrow, have alſo more helps againſt them from Scripture, which is given by Inſpiration from God, and therefore muſt be better and more certain then of Mans Invention and Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>

This is true in ſeeking after Happineſs and Prevention of Miſery by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Men or our own Wiſdom and ways; they all are diſappoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, for it is to be had in God only. The Men of this World look after good in Fleſh, and ſo they would keep off Evil; but when that is ſtricken and begins to fade, when it cannot relliſh by reaſon of Pain, and the anguiſh of Spirit doth ſo break forth that this is not able any longer to pacifie, then they reſort to the Wiſdom of Mans words, but that will not profit nor deliver them; So they muſt lie down under their Calamities, expecting worſe things, or come unto God and his Word.

               <p>It is Impertinent, if not Sinful to diſſwade them from Holy things who delight therein: As long as they can go on in ſuch a courſe all their days, let them do as much as Gods Grace ſhall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect rhem.

The Scripture makes fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent mention of thoſe who do not enough for Heaven, but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing againſt them who do too much, for there is no danger of exceeding. That particularly lays down all things neceſſary and relating to Mans Salvation, and alſo ſpeaks of his temporal Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs in Subordination to that, yet there is not one word men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned concerning Religious Melancholy or Mopiſhneſs. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out queſtion, there were ſome in the days of the inſpired Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, whoſe Converſation was obnoxious to that Character as now. What the World calls Melancholy in Scripture Phraſe is <hi>Sorrow,</hi> and to that ſomewhat is ſaid by way of Comfort; but it was to be in God, not to take people off, nor to have recourſe to thoſe Arts as Sinners do. The beſt way of ſolving Fears, Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and Diſquiet, is to give a people a right underſtanding of them; but let none reſort to the Pleaſures of Sin and idle Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, which increaſe, but not cure them.

               <p>Is there then nothing in bodily Conſtitution? Not ſo much as is pretended, and that again may be altered. The corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Body preſſeth down the Soul which is common to all; and that difference of temper in particular perſons, which yet is not ſo much as commonly talked of, ſerves for an Exerciſe and Tryal of the greater Vertue: That the Soul may yet aſcend and lift up it ſelf. And then the Power of Gods Grace and their complying with it can, and doth actually change the natures of Men. That natural tendency and Seriouſneſs was therefore put in them to move towards their right end; And alſo finding no true Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs here, they are prompted to look out for one to come. It is ſo ordered by the good God that all Mankind might be ſaved and come to the Knowledge of the Truth, ſome more this way, ſome another, according to their Inclinations of Soul, Body and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of Life.

The great miſtake is, we obſerve many things without the reaſon of them. All things tend to their Center; and what is in Man moves towards his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per end, which is doing the things for which God hath made him.

Remember the days paſt before habitual Sin and evil Habits came on, to what did the Motions within aſpire and prompt unto? Before the Spirit was made unclean, did it not ſoar up towards the Father of Spirits? When it was not cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted with Malice and Stubboinneſs, Had you not a good mind towards God? when your Deſires were Pure and Sincere, After whom were they moſt ſutably inclined? To him above, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing here. Then you were whiſpered by Satan, or told by his Inſtruments, to go that way was to be Melancholy, and to avoid that you did follow Sin and Vanity. Is not this really Sorrow? But it may be through the Deceitfulneſs of Sin thou canſt not tell how to get out, but thou muſt. Be adviſed firſt to forbear the outward Acts, <hi>VVaſh and make Clean,</hi> put away your former E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Doings, the Clouds will go off, and the Sun may again appear in its full Might. Then reſume thy former Thoughts, and do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly. This kind of Melancholy leads up to the <hi>Moſt High,</hi> from whom cometh every Good thing. Obſerve all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, but there is no need of laying any greater Burden
<pb n="665" facs="tcp:46484:319"/> on thy ſelf by performances which are not required. The Service God hath inſtituted is reaſonable, which may be done with a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and willing mind.</p>
               <p>Be diligent in thy Calling, for this is the Will of God, and agreeable to Peace as an Employment of thoſe powers of Body and Mind. Keep good Company, for there is a ſtrong inclination in our Nature toward this. And though now we are often ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from one another by our ſeveral Buſineſs and Action, yet theſe ſhall ceaſe when the times of refreſhing ſhall come, when there ſhall be no need of Action becauſe the end is obtained. We are not now to be always in Company, for we have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe to do, and alſo they do not continually divert through the remainders of Sin and Ignorance; though ſo much the more according as we are purged from theſe, and have leſs Avocation. All Melancholy and Diſquiet which is the ſame thing, doth ariſe from not anſwering the natural ends, and therefore the way to avoid it, is to know our own Frame, and to carefully comply with the juſt tendencies thereof.</p>
               <p>All irregularity and diſorder in the Fleſh is Sickneſs or Pain. <note place="margin">Of neſs. Sick.</note> 
                  <hi>And the Lord God formed Man out of the Duſt of the Ground,</hi> Gen. 2. 7. Then the Ground was not Accurſed, nor the Creature brought into the bondage of Corruption; ſo it is conceived he was made Immortal, but after his Tranſgreſſion Thorns and Thiſtles ſprang up, the Seed of Diſeaſes and Mortality was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in with the Juice of the forbidden Fruit. Sickneſs came <note place="margin">Gen. 2. 19.</note> into the World upon Man and upon Beaſt, and every living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, for they were formed out of the Ground before the Fall. They partake of the Puniſhment of Original Sin, but not ſo <note place="margin">Jer. 12. 4.</note> much of Actual and Intermedial Sins; for it may be obſerved, that they do not languiſh under pain or Ilneſs from within (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs by Mans Tampering and Cruelty) until what brings on their Death. Whence we learn that to avoid Sickneſs or Pain, To Hereditary Guilt let us add as little more as we can; Let us com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with Gods Law, which he hath revealed for the Benefit of miſerable and falen Man. Be Temperate in all things, uſe La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and Exerciſe according to the meaſure God hath ordained. it is no unbecoming thing to go to the Herd and conſider their ways, for Health is a preſent and ſenſible good. We are alike
<pb n="666" facs="tcp:46484:320"/> according to the Body with them: The different ſhape doth not alter much, as appears by their ſeveral Kinds. How is their well Being and ſound Conſtitution preſerved? Nature goes on with them according to its Courſe. They eat what is whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and ſutable, without ſuperadded Sauces and Mixture. Think upon their Reſt and Sleep, which they leave off before the riſing of the Sun. See them in their goings forth and comings in, what degrees of Motion they uſe, and they are better for doing ſo much as deſigned unto. The Horſe and Ox performing due Service do better run out their appointed time, nor periſh ſooner unleſs o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver wrought by Tyranny or Covetouſneſs. A good Man is Merciful unto his Beaſt: Much more ſhould thoſe that are Rich have the like in conſideration for Servants and the Poorer part of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. Not ſuffering them to Labour beyond their Strength, for that exhauſts and conſumes the vital Spirits, as again others do Deſtroy themſelves before their time by Sloth and Idleneſs. Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration is excellent, and carries through all things of the World.</p>
               <p>When the Faculties of mind are pure and free in a ſound Body, they can better exert themſelves. It is a great Bleſſing ſrom God, ſo it is to be ſought for and preſerved by his eſtabliſhed means. <hi>What Man is he that deſireth Life, and loveth many days that he may ſee Good? keep thy Tongue from Evil, and thy Lips from ſpeaking Guile. Depart from Evil and do Good, ſeek Peace and purſue it. The Eyes of the Lord are upon the Righteous, and his Ears are open unto their Cry,</hi> Pſal. 34. 12, 13, 14, 15. This is the way to prevent loſs of Liberty, or Life from the offended Magiſtrate, Violence and Miſchief from a Quarrelling Neighbour, ſo he is ſafe as to Man; And then from within himſelf, Nothing is ſo good a remedy to keep the Body in its due Temperament, as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voiding Sin and doing commanded Duty. Gods Providence here ſtands engaged for outward Accidents and Caſualties. Sickneſs or Pain doth happen one of theſe three ways, and ſo we are taught as to each of them. <hi>Ye ſhall ſerve the Lord your God, and he ſhall Bleſs thy Bread and thy Water: And I will take away Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs from the midſt of thee,</hi> Exod. 23. 25. He hath put a ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Wholeſomeneſs and Nouriſhment in thoſe Creatures appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for our Food; and if any Poyſon or Hurt ſhould be in them, (as that is ſeldom in common things, but rather in new Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="667" facs="tcp:46484:320"/> of Luxury) he can by a Thought or ſome other manner di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert from receiving thereof, or afterwards cauſe that it ſhall not hurt them. Nature, which is made the great Temptation to Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief, doth plainly manifeſt his Eternal Power and Godhead, for he firſt erected ſuch a ſtanding Courſe of things, and even now Governs it; He over-rules the whole, and diſpoſes each part thereof. So he is not to be thruſt out, but ſhould be ſought unto as well as the Phyſitians and outward Help. He in the firſt place, <note place="margin">2 Chron. 16. 11, 12.</note> and they in Subordination unto him. The dull and unthankful World will cry out upon ſuch a Preſcription or Plaiſter, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſhall have the thanks who was the Inſtrument of bringing it unto them. Whereas they might remember who made the Body; Who was it that gave Skill and Underſtanding to the Phyſitian? He can alſo turn his Counſel into Fooliſhneſs. It was God who firſt made and gave that Vertue in Phyſick and Salve to Heal, for otherwiſe a piece of Wood might do the ſame. He hath endued things with their ſeveral Efficacies and Uſes. <hi>I taught</hi> Ephraim <hi>alſo to go, taking them by their Arms: But they knew not that I Healed them,</hi> Hoſ. 11. 3. He gives, preſerves and continues our Health. But yet what is corruptible and weak, will wax old and decay. Health conſiſts in ſuch an exact diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Humours, which is eaſily diſturbed by Violence from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, Defect or Exceſs from within. The Goodneſs and Wiſdom above doth ordain Strength out of Weakneſs, and continuance from tottering things; otherwiſe it were to be admired that we are not Sick always inſtead of being ſo ſometimes. A Sparrow doth not fall to the ground without the Will of our heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: Nor any Chaſtiſment light upon the Sons and Daughters of Men, without his Permiſſion or Order. He ſuffers ſuch an one to fall under the harm of a ſecond Cauſe, or adverſe Accident. If we would ſearch and examine to the utmoſt, then confeſs and give Glory unto God, we might many times find our Diſeaſe to be the natural effect of ſome Sin or Provocation: We became at firſt ſubject unto Sickneſs by Sin only; So if we reflect up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <note place="margin">Gen. 2. 17.</note> all our foregoing Actions and Circumſtances, There is ſome e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil which inſenſibly alters and breaks the ſound Conſtitution, or brings it on Speedily and Violently. The next thing is to be humbled for the ſame, to <hi>accept the Puniſhment of our Iniquity,</hi> Lev. 26. 43. <hi>I will bear the Indignation of the Lord, for I have
<pb n="668" facs="tcp:46484:321"/> Sinned againſt him,</hi> Mic. 7. 9. We muſt ſincerely reſolve, if God ſhould ſpare us this time, to watch more carefully againſt the ſame for the future, now to be unfeignedly ſorry for it, and to cry mightily unto God. <hi>The King of</hi> Iſrael <hi>is a Merciful King,</hi> he will be Appeaſed and Reconciled.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Behold Happy is the Man whom God Correcteth: Therefore deſpiſe not thou the Cbaſtening of the Almighty,</hi> Job 5. 17. Then he fully perceives that falſe ſhew of Happineſs, with which Fools and Blind are deluded all along: Which they might know in the mean while if they would conſider it throughly, as they do ever and anon ſlightly. Outward things cannot give ſo much aid as they vainly promiſe. They are all paſſed away as a Dream, and cannot help in the greateſt time of need. <hi>My Fleſh and my Heart faileth, but God is the ſtrength of my Heart and my Portion for ever,</hi> Pſal. 73. 26. If the Conſcience is accuſed by sin, let the Sick Man caſt it forth by Confeſſion and Prayer; and the Sea will ceaſe from raging: The mind will become more quiet. Whether the Body dies or lives he is ſafe, when he hath done all things to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Mercy and acceptance of Almighty God.</p>
               <p>It is a ſad Story of thoſe who in time of Dangerous Sickneſs have made great ſhews of Reformation and Amendment, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Recovery have returned again unto Folly. <hi>And they have not cryed unto me with their Heart, when they howled upon their Beds,</hi> Hoſ. 7. 14. Which word imports no true in ward Sorrow, but an outward noiſe upon apprehenſion of Danger, which goes off with it. However God cannot be impoſed upon, he knows the Thoughts long before, ſearches the Heart and tries the Reins, diſcovers the bottom and inward reſerves, according to which he will judge. So it is not what they pretend, but what they will really be. Thoſe who have been for a ſuperficial and ſlight Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, which they did hope might avail if they ſhould Die, but if they Recover then to return to their former evil ways, I ſay theſe ſhould have done well to have conſidered, What moved them to any Repentance at all; the ſame ſhould engage them to continue and perfect it. For admit you ſhould certainly live, it is but a Reprieve only: You will be Sick again, or what is worſe cut off ſuddenly. And then things will appear exactly at the ſame manner again, yea, worſe for the former Hypocriſie and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling. As alſo for that more Sin and Guilt is increaſed. How
<pb n="669" facs="tcp:46484:321"/> many years may be added unto your Life is not known, but it will be a ſad thing to have lived Ionger, to have committed more Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, and ſo Die hardened, Impenitent or feigned at laſt. At firſt recovery is uncertain, for many have lulled themſelves with hope thereof, till Death hath been upon them. Many things might be urged to diſſwade people from doing Fooliſhly and Preſumptuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Their own Eternal Happineſs or Miſery lies at ſtake, It is not a matter to trifle or deal deceitful with. Be prevailed upon as you tender the good of Soul and Body, to have your Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance true and ſincere. By the Trouble or Pain of them, think of the <hi>Worm which ſhall never die, and the Fire which ſhall not be quenched,</hi> and which are to be eſcaped from only this way. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in God and Jeſus Chriſt, that all things contained in the old and new Teſtament are certainly true. Faith and Repentance are neceſſary for all Men both in time of Health and Sickneſs; which whoſo hath according to Truth is ſure, for theſe intitle unto the Promiſes of him with whom we have to do.</p>
               <p>Health doth conſiſt in a regular Diſpoſition and due Motion of each part of the Body: None can ſee into himſelf, or tell the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act manner how as to every particular. <hi>I was made in ſecret, and curiouſly VVrought in the loweſt parts of the Earth.

None of us can look into the Womb, or whilſt in Life can ſee how all the Members and Parts within do work and move, yet after the Body is dead we may perceive ſomewhat by Diſſections, which is gueſs and uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; for if a number of Men ſhould come into the Shop of an excellent Artiſt, ſeeing his Tools and Inſtruments only, One may think this, another that, and ſo may be divided, but can never find out the exact manner of his Art. He that ſees a dead Carkaſe unleſs he were put in mind by himſelf carrying about one of the ſame likeneſs, would be at a ſtand to anſwer the Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Was this lump ever in Life? He could never by his own Wit and Invention find out the way how it was. He would alſo admire how each part both within and without did move and actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate. So wonderful and fearful are Gods Works, which puzzle the Underſtanding of Man.

He hath kept this in his own Power. All the ways he hath ſet out for Nature to go according unto, are not yet known. Indeed many of them have been ſearched after, and ſome found: but not all, for then thoſe Diſeaſes would be Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red which were not firſt Mortal and Irrecoverable. The preventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of, and recovery out of Sickneſs doth depend upon the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Truth and right way, which being hidden to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern more thereof, is by Probability and Diſcourſe, for hereby <note place="margin">Pſal. 85. 11. 2 Tim. 3. 7.</note> we come to the knowledge of what is concealed, as by looking with the outward Eye, to ſearch out what is loſt above Ground. Truth is the very Nature of things without as they are fixed and connected together, and that inferring from one thing to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is the means to find it out. Now becauſe Conſequences are diverſe, True and Fallacious, Obſcure and Plain; to rightly diſcern between them and alſo to apprehend, to go from things more known, unto thoſe that are leſs, this is the Office and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment of Reaſon. But before, and after all, <hi>God giveth Wiſdom unto the Wiſe, and Knowledge to them that know Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. He revealeth the deep and ſecret things,</hi> Dan. 2. 21. 22. He may at length diſcover thoſe Rules and Orders concerning the Body of Man, how at firſt it is made for ſuch a continuance, by what ways it moves, what keeps on its courſe, and what ſtops, that Help and Remedy may be had to each, So that more may run out the days of their appointed time. Who knows but it may be fulfilled all the World over, what is written? <hi>Thus ſaith The Lord of Hoſts, There ſhall yet old Men and old Women dwell in the Streets of</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>and every Man with his Staff in his Hand for very Age,</hi> Zech. 8. 4.</p>

The thoughts of paſt ſoundneſs and freedom from Pain do enhaunce the preſent; but yet this Balm may ſoften, for the Pain is tranſitory. The days and hours paſt are the ſame as if expired in Pleaſure, the preſent ſlips back likewiſe, ſo the leſs is behind, and all that will have an end juſt the ſame as if it had never been at all. This is ſeldom Mortal, but if it ſhould, then care is to be had of a well grounded Hope, which ſends up to that place, <hi>Where ſhall not be any more Pain, for the former things are paſſed away,</hi> Rev. 21. 4. To obtain that is our buſineſs all our Life long before Sickneſs and Pain come on, which is a ſure Refuge and Rejoycing in the evil day. The Spirit is quiet and undiſturbed, though the Fleſh doth ſuffer. Even here God hath ordained remedies and means, ſo they are to be uſed for Reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very and Deliverance.</p>
               <p>Thoſe which are called Afflictions of Eſtate, Many of them <note place="margin">of Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate.</note> are ſo far without that they would not torment at all if we had no thoughts of them. If we do not hear, or forget, or are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mindful, they do not diſturb; but letting them into the Soul with worſe Circumſtances and Aggravations, here is the Sting of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Adverſities. We admit the ſence thereof to have a deep and continued impreſſion in our minds, but what may be adminiſtred for Comfort we caſt a ſlight glance towards that, concluding it unable to help and ſo will have none of it, or make a ſmall try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and leave off preſently, and will not ſuffer it to have the alike ſtay and influence over us as the other hath. Thus are we partial to our own loſs, and wilfully deprive our ſelves of Contentment. This proceeds from the cunning Wiles of the Enemy, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually lets our Happineſs, and here ſerves an end by raiſing up the ſpirit of Murmuring, and ſubtilly leads into Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Sin, taking advantage of our froward and fooliſh Nature, <note place="margin">Prov. 19. 3.</note> which is preſently upon the fret, and there is a way ſhewed to get out, but we have no Heart unto it; When the Evil is upon us, God holds forth a Remedy by Grace and Knowledge; ſo we a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone are to be blamed if we do not accept thereof. Sometimes we imagine it is an Evil, when it is none, which vaniſhes as ſoon as we ſuffer our underſtanding to be convinced to the contrary.

But where it was ſo according to Truth, thoſe of old were at a loſs how to obtain Remedy for it, for Money is one of thoſe hard things which require both Power and Skill to get it. Wiſdom alone might ſhew the way, but cannot wreſt it by Violence or fair In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaty: So people were forced to ſit down and Comfort them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as well as they could, when they were neceſſitated to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure Inconvenience and Pain all their days, and afterwards know not what ſhall become of them. They were in an hard Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to come forth once into the World to ſuffer Labour and Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, Hunger and Thirſt, Cold and Nakedneſs, and have no way ſhewed or aſſurance given, how or when they ſhould be Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted for the time wherein they had theſe evil things. But divine Revelation ſets all this right, which relies upon the ſame Word and Power, and therefore it is as impoſſible to fail, as that the World ſhould fall down into Rubbiſh.

<pb n="678" facs="tcp:46484:326"/> if they preſerved their Dignity) ſhould yet be carried away with the errour and abſurd Partiality of the World. A ſign how lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle they are governed by Faith and Reaſon, but they are led on by Sence and Cuſtom. Which would do us moſt good, will be ſeen when the Lord of all ſhall demand how we have done according <note place="margin">Mat. 25. 14, 19.</note> to the Laws and Power he gave unto us.</p>
               <p>Were thoſe falſe opinions of things taken away, as it would be a great help to our Duty, ſo to preſent Peace and Content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: For the generality of Mankind being Slaves to the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of others, do more according to what they think then them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Such a thing could be let alone, but the Faſhion and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jority is for it, and they muſt do as the reſt. Again, they could be without it, but Reputation and Eſteem of others make it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary. Who go not according to Conſcience towards God, yet do upon the very ſame Principles towards Men, for would they do the ſame to pleaſe and get Honour from him (who is more then all the many Inhabitants of the World) as they do from one another, they were in the right. Which ſeems to ſhew that what God requires is not only eaſie, and may be performed, but there is a propenſion in the Heart of Man to do even the ſame, for he doth it in common Acts, though he doth not ſtretch up this Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple to the high and right end. Would he do ſo in Obedience unto God, as to recommend himſelf unto others; take and go according to his Eſtimation of things, (For who knows them bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then he that made and eſtabliſhed them?) rather then ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the common Vogue of others, which is meer Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Fancy of the multitude, not to be juſtified from Truth nor Reaſon, then he would be certainly Happy. Let not thy Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons be according to others Sayings, but be ruled by the Direction of Gods Word, for this in moſt things is contrary to what is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly received among us.</p>

Thoſe poor Wretches ſhall riſe and Condemn thee, for they were contented with leſs things. Art thou better then they? Pride will dictate ſo, why, if they had the ſame Advantage for Education they would have been the ſame alſo, but even now God is more pleaſed with them, becauſe they are better ſatisfied with little then thou with more.

                  </gap>fficient for your na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural needs, Labour therewith and be contented.</p>
               <p>It is time to come and viſit thoſe who are poor indeed, that they may ſee the way how their Condition is to be remedied. It is a ſore Evil depreſſing the mind, and making the Body ſeem yet more Vile and Sordid. <hi>Yet now our Fleſh is as the Fleſh of our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, our Children as their Children,</hi> Neh. 5. 5. There is no need of deſcribing their Miſeries, for they are too much known and felt already. Evil is no further to be manifeſted then is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarv for Proviſion againſt it, as a Wound is to be Launced in order to a Cure. It is alledged, That Cuſtom, Their low Thoughts and Deſires make this Condition eaſily born, which we otherwiſe uſed think inſupportable. But a continued Evil which one is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to ſubmit unto all his days, is ſo much the more Grievous. Indeed it is Wiſdom to have moderate deſires ſtretched no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="681" facs="tcp:46484:327"/> then the true worth and value of the thing. There are Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects anſwering to each Faculty in Man, he is made of periſhingFleſh and an immortal spirit, the one for Earthly things, the other for Heavenly; So he hath different deſires according to them, One covets after the things here, and is contented, The other thoſe above which at preſent he is only ſeeking and in expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of, for they are to be revealed hereafter. Now the error may be two ways: if the Man lets out both after preſent and viſible things, then he is but half ſatisfied; On the contrary, it is when they are both ſtifled and confined within this World, when they are preſſed down to the Earth, and aim no further. We have Inſtances of both miſtakes in the Rich Voluptuary, and the Poor and Fooliſh perſon; the firſt runs out after Happineſs till he is tired and diſappointed; the other cannot do that through Want but he rubs through as contentedly as he can with what is before him, not thinking above, but is Ignorant and unmindful as to any thing more, and ſo concludes all is well enough; for the firſt he is not to be blamed, but the latter ſinks into Deſtruction and Miſery.</p>
               <p>Conſider ye Poor, you have ſo much Knowledge as to be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to be Happy, then you muſt learn to <hi>know the Way of the Lord, and the Judgement of your God,</hi> for there are no other means of <note place="margin">Jer. 5. 4.</note> being ſo, and the neglect is Dangerous. If you will not regard this, your Condition is not likely to be mended in this World; and it will be Ten Thouſand degrees worſe in that which is to come. Here you have Comfort and Aſſurance that all your preſent Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings will have an end; but then another Life doth begin, and if you ſhould be Miſerable in that alſo, there will be no redreſs for Thouſand Thouſands of Years. There is no way to avoid that, but to get God for your Friend whilſt you are here, which is done by Knowledge of him and Obedience to his Commands in Scripture; unleſs you do this you will be Miſerable now, and Miſerable to all Eternity. God brought you into this World when you never thought of it, and he will raiſe you up again, both Soul and Body in another State, though you now fancy and wiſh otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>Remember to ſerve the Lord your God, for his gracious Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes are more to your Condition. When he had left the Earth to the Sons of Men, ſome by Covetouſneſs, Oppreſſion, Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and Deceit did ſcramble and take more, ſo others came to
<pb n="682" facs="tcp:46484:328"/> be in Want and evil Intreated. But God ſhews himſelf diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed therewith, and declares in his Word that he would take their part. <hi>For the Oppreſſion of the Poor, for the Sighing of the Needy, now will I ariſe, (ſaith the Lord) I will ſet him in Safety from him that puffeth at him,</hi> Pſal. 12. 5. <hi>I know that the Lord will maintain the Cauſe of the Afflicted, and the Right of the Poor,</hi> Pſal. 140. 12. <hi>A Father of the Fatherleſs, a Judge of the Widows is God in his holy Habitation: Thy Congregation hath dwelt therein, thou O God haſt of thy Goodneſs prepared for the Poor,</hi> Pſal. 68. 5, 10. What follows next from the Divinely Inſpired Pen-Man? (who was a King, and did not turn Advocate for them out of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity) Something at firſt which ſeems to have no Connexion on the former, when there doth lie an hidden meaning; <hi>The Lord gave the Word, great was the Company of thoſe that Publiſhed it,</hi> verſe 11. In this he more eſpecially provides for them, for the way is ſhewed how they are to be relieved both by themſelves and others. He manifeſts his power and Sovereignty that he hath commanded it to be done. As Lord over free Creatures, he would have it done by them freely. He makes known his pleaſure, and hath left to them whither they will comply with it; Now is the time of Tryal. But he will confirm all the Truth he hath ſpoken by his Prophets, Son and Apoſtles. He will Reward and Puniſh according to what is written, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 12. which is as true, as if already paſt and fulfilled.</p>
               <p>There are Directions for the Poor, which if they follow, they may either come out of their Poverty, or have it ſanctified unto them. They are to obey God in all thoſe Commandments he hath given; and then they muſt uſe the means, particularly diligent Labour and Honeſty. They are alſo to avoid thoſe Sins of Idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Pride, Drunkenneſs, Prodigality and unneceſſary Expence which bring on Poverty. God hath eſtabliſhed things by way of ſecond Cauſes and outward Means, which are to be uſed. When theſe are ſhewed and put in our power, he that will not comply with them, it is his own fault if he is Poor, and he ſuffers juſtly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Inconveniencies thereof. Indeed they are ſo Afflicting, that unleſs Men are ſottiſh Fools, and idle Drones, they will do any thing to be relieved. Methinks I ſee the yearning Bowels of Thouſands throughout this Nation, who are in Doubt and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs, they fain would have a Livelihood, they look out any way, but ſee none. What Cares and Fears are about this one thing?
<pb n="683" facs="tcp:46484:328"/> We are apt through Ignorance and Unbelief to ſeek for Help in Affliction every way rather then the right; and what we ſhould firſt, we do laſt of all when driven by the failure of all other means. Many do not <hi>firſt ſeek the Kingdom of God and his Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> Nor conſider who made and brought them up hitherto, Who hath fed them all their life long. This they do not diſcern nor are thankful for it, God is not in all their Thoughts. And when they come to pinch and be in ſtrait, then they uſe all ways right or wrong. And conclude falſly, that if they cannot have a main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance by both manner of means, much leſs if they obſerved only thoſe which are lawful and good. Whereas by venturing upon evil and unjuſt things, they forfeit their right to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 33. 15, 16. <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 33. And alſo through their Knavery and Idleneſs, it comes to paſs that others will not truſt or not deal with them. Theſe judging only by common Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents and the things before them, how it goes with others in the World who do Wickedly and yet Thrive; and therefore they are encouraged to try, and if it doth not fall out ſo with them, they Murmure at their hard Condition. Not much unlike thoſe of whom the Prophet ſpeaks, <hi>It ſhall come to paſs when they ſhall be Hungry they ſhall ſret themſelves, and curſe their King, and their God, and look upwards,</hi> Iſa. 8. 21. Be enraged at him whoſe Laws eſtabliſh Property, for giving ſo much to one and ſo little to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. And think hard of the Lord who Governs the World for ſuffering things ſo to be. But for all the Mutterings of the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly, <hi>They that know thy Name will put their Truſt in thee, for thou Lord haſt not for ſaken them that ſeek thee,</hi> Pſal. 9. 10. If they would go to him in the firſt place, pray for his Direction, uſe his appointed means, and do nothing more then is right; they would not be reduced to ſo great ſtraits as many are. There may be Surmiſes and Frightnings of Poverty, which are Temptations of the Enemy to Sin and Diſtruſt, which are ſuffered for proving us; but he that reſolves for all to go on in known duty, avoiding Sin and Knavery, ſhall be provided for. As it is juſt and reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able that a Man ſhould Eat the Labour of his Hands, ſo it is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe aſſented by all, that he who doth Eat ſhould Work for it; and they do not grudge the former to have the latter. This Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple is fixt in the minds of Men by God who made them, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained all things for their uſe to be had by Labour. None pities
<pb n="684" facs="tcp:46484:329"/> him who neglects it, although he Wants. Even thoſe who have to live without (if they do not make it up by other ways of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good) derogate from this great Law and Inſtitution. The Lazy Gentleman and Idle Beggar do vary from it; the one to his greater future account, and the other to his preſent Miſery. But who conſiders of things, and hath right apprehenſions, not corrupted with Pride or Sloth, is glad and thankful that things are ſo diſpoſed of, and willingly reaches forth when they may be ſo had.</p>

So here the Law of the Realm hath made a ſlender Proviſion for the Poor, and nevertheleſs room is left for the Alms of good and willing people. God doth oblige from his own Dominion, Property and Greatneſs, and alſo by Arguments taken from themſelves.

The Wiſe Men of old ſaid little or nothing as to Alms-giving unleſs by way of Generoſity and vain glorious Beneficence. They thought it did derogate from Prudence to give away his own and ſee no good come of it. Every one did hold that ſo faſt that it was not in the power of Mans Wiſdom by Argument and Perſwaſion to get it from them. So far it is true, for the Tongues of Men and Angels that can move people to every thing beſides, yet it is not ſufficient that they might part with beloved Mammon, though for ſupport of their Poor Neighbour. Nothing but the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of God can do as to this; <hi>for that where believed, muſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade Men.</hi> Theſe have the like reaſon to do it as others through Unbelief to refrain, for they are not willing to part with a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty for an uncertainty, the Money they have in their Hands, but if given away, it is none of their own, and they are not aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured of finding any good thereof. But who have Faith will not call that uncertain, which God hath promiſed. <hi>Sell that ye have, and give Alms, provide your ſelves Bags which wax not old, a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in the Heavens that faileth not,</hi> Luke 12. 33. Seeing you are Mortal and muſt be taken away from your Riches and Poſſeſſions, Is it not a better and a more Wiſe way ſo to diſpoſe, that they may ſtand the owners in ſome ſtead? for it is certain and evident that to keep after the manner of worldly Men, would avail no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="686" facs="tcp:46484:330"/> at all. Whatever is ſpent in Pride or Pleaſure, in Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality or Vain things, is conſumed at the inſtant, there is an end, and no more; but what is given, that remains a Sacrifice well Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing unto God. <hi>He that giveth to the Poor lendeth to the Lord, and that which he giveth will he pay him again,</hi> Prov. 19. 17. <hi>For aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as ye have done it unto the leaſt of my Brethren, ye have done it unto me,</hi> Mat. 25. 40. <hi>He which ſoweth ſparingly ſhall reap alſo ſparingly, and he that Soweth bountifully ſhall reap alſo bountifully,</hi> 2 Cor 9 6. There is no need of citing more Texts, but for people to be put in mind and ſtirred up to comply therewith. What hinders? If ye believe in God, ye muſt believe what he hath here ſpoken by his Son and Servants. And this doth not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon an evil Heart of Unbelief or Fancy to the contrary, but known to God are all his Decrees according to which he will deal with all Mankind at laſt. Either Stupidity or want of Faith doth not alter the Caſe. And ſince theſe things are ſo, The rich of this World have the ſame Exhortation to be <hi>ready to Diſtribute, willing to Communicate,</hi> as now for doing as they do either by ſordidly keeping, or expending it in the Faſhion and Senſuality; for they may judge which is likely to turn to moſt Good and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit to themſelves at long run. They may as well ſend forth Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence to reap thereof in the Kingdom of Heaven, as now the Husband Man ſoweth Seed in order to Harveſt, though for the preſent it ſeems loſt and buried in the ground.</p>
               <p>Do not ſhift it off from your ſelves to Clergy-Men, who have Church Perferments, and live by Religion, and therefore are to give more freely. Admitting that, yet in this you argue againſt your ſelves, are Enemies to your own Glory and Recompence. There is much talk they ſhould do this or that, but there is no difference in the Commandments of God to one more then the other. All are equally preſſed to the obſervance of them, there is nothing more ſtrictly enjoyned nor greater Duty laid on the Prieſt then the People, ſaving what relates to the diſtinguiſhing Office; and Alms giving is not particularly mentioned under that. All are the Creatures and Servants of the ſame God, and ow the like Subjection unto him. What if it ſhould be ſaid? You likewiſe live by Religion, for He unto whom it all relates, holds your Souls in Life; he placed you under ſuch Parents from whom your Inheritance deſcended, or gave you power to get Wealth; but
<pb n="687" facs="tcp:46484:330"/> beſides, you ow your keeping of abundance to this only; for here is founded <hi>Meum</hi> and <hi>Tuum,</hi> the diſtinction of Right and Wrong, Take away the ſence of this, all Confuſion would come in; Thoſe in Diſtreſs and deep Poverty might uſe Rapine and Fraud, and they could be no loſers if the utmoſt was to be ſent out of this Troubleſome and Miſerable World; <hi>But the Wrath of God which is revealed here againſt all <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngodlineſs and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nrighteouſneſs of Men,</hi> which is to be Executed in another place, keeps things in order. It is your Intereſt to be Religious towards God as well as Loyal to the King, for he eſtabliſheth Kingdoms and property. He made Man upright, and when thoſe Principles of evil came in afterwards, did ſend forth his <hi>Mercy</hi> and <hi>Truth</hi> without which <hi>our Souls would be among Lyons.</hi> The Proud and Scornful Men ſhould have a care how they ſpeak Contemptibly of his Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. What the Apoſtle ſaith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 13, 14. may ſilence them; and the ſame God hath ordained that, who maintains all the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and Diverſity which is in the World.</p>
               <p>Whatſoever is more then the Neceſſity and Conveniencies of each Family belongeth to the Poor and is their due. It appears from <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 28. that thoſe in ordinary Employments are to diſpoſe of what is more then ſatisfieth themſelves, ſo there is the ſame reaſon that thoſe higher ſhould likewiſe proportionably, juſt keep up the diſtinction, but otherwiſe come as near equality as may be; for thoſe under us would willingly have ſome Comforts of Life as our ſelves.

Neither is there ſo great ſtreſs to be laid on this Duty, for it is juſtice and not Merit, called <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> Pſal 37. 25. Pſal. 112. 9. Dan. 4. 27. a giving that which is due and equal. Nor ſhould they be Proud that do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing towards it, but thank God who enabled them; for it is Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Themſelves ſhould acknowledge Gods goodneſs that they are in ſuch a Condition as to give Alms and not receive them: Thoſe rather are to be commended (if any praiſe is due for what is Chedience) who are partakers, in cheerfully bearing their Condition. Indeed unleſs the Scripture did ſpeak expreſly of a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Reward, as it doth to this more particularly then any other Duty, (whether fore-ſeeing Mens backwardneſs and to give grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter encouragement, or to ſatisfie this doubt) One that did exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
<pb n="688" facs="tcp:46484:331"/> the reaſon of things would ſcarce think thereof, becauſe they have the more already in hand to do it, and a Steward that hath Money given him to lay out ſo much for his Maſters uſe, the reſt for his own, expects no more. But God to ſhew his extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Goodneſs, and to make us more ready to ſupply the want of his poor Creatures, hath already committed wherewithal by giving a more plentiful uſe, and alſo a promiſe of ſometh ng more to come. Some Primitive Writers have ſpoken too Hyperboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally concerning Alms, Others turn them to merit of forgiveneſs of Sin. But herein they do exceed, for ſo much is not to be depended thereon. Alms do not make Atonement for Sin. Though ſome may be found who would give as largely as he in <hi>Micah</hi> for the Sin of his Soul, yet it will not do unleſs it be repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of and forſaken. It is not come to that for the Rich to have a Licence to Sin, or the Poor to miſs of Forgiveneſs for want of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. Neither is it ſuch an extraordinary good Work above all others, for things are to be ſtated aright: It being a Temporal kindneſs to the worſe part, for all which they go away and die, and it is not much minded: ſo it is not to be compared to the good done to Souls, for this ever remains. The other is more then what is ſaid, <hi>To keep Life only to longer Miſery,</hi> for that is a poor Relief. The Chriſtian Charity doth, or ſhould go further, even to have not only bare Neceſſities but Refreſhments of Life alſo, for we could not be ſo contented, and they are likewiſe deſirous of more, The great Law, <hi>Love thy Neighbour as thy ſelf</hi> dictates thus much.</p>
               <p>Thus we ſee how it ſtandeth with our Brethren, how God hath provided for them in his Grace and Revelation, he doth his part, but we do not ours. As the Apoſtle argues, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2. 15, 16. It is the ſame a little higher. We pray to God for them, that he would Relieve thoſe Afflicted in Mind, Body and Eſtate; and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps think hardly becauſe they are not; when he hath ſet out the means and left it in our power; for if we would do as he hath ſaid and commanded in Scripture, all thoſe ſeveral Afflictions would be actually Relieved. They would be Comforted and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported in the mean time, till God gives an happy Iſſue and Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance out of them, which he will certainly do if we prepare and become worthy getting the Qualification he there ſhews.</p>
               <pb n="689" facs="tcp:46484:331"/>
               <p>This might be known by his Goodneſs and Truth already, let any one fulfil the terms of the Covenant of ſincere and univerſal <note place="margin">Concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Chapter.</note> Obedience, <hi>Turn from every evil way;</hi> for the want of that is the only hindrance to Loving of God with all the Soul, and all the Mind. One Sin is the <hi>Root that beareth Gall and Wormwood,</hi> and hinders all theſe good effects. But whoſo keeps himſelf from that, let him ſeek after Knowledge, for to that he is Commanded: Then come and ſee how it is Written. When the Law of God is in his inward parts, when The Kingdom of God both in Word and Power is within him, there is a Remedy for all manner of Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities by comfortable Thoughts to the Soul. What things may be known without, there is no need of particular mention in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. When that Reaſon God hath given prompts to outward means, this ſhews the lawfulneſs of them; for Eaſe and Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance may be ſought for the Body, as Comfort and Freedom to the Soul. And further it is excellently conſulted as to the Afflictions of Eſtate. O ye Sons and Daughters of Sorrow, be fully aſſured that God is Good ſtill. <hi>All the Paths of the Lord are Mercy and Truth unto ſuch as keep his Covenant and Teſtimonies,</hi> Pſal. 25. 10. Think of Almighty God by his Works and his Word, and from the good and uſefulneſs of things pertaining to us. Let us know our ſelves, remembring we are but Men and imperfect Creatures. Call to mind how Evil came into the World through Sin, though it is not taken away, yet Help is ordained againſt it. It is Written and found true of the Benefits of the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> unto whom all the Scripture hath Relation. <hi>Surely he hath born our Griefs and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed our Sorrows,</hi> Iſa. 53. 4. It is but reaſonable we ſhould have ſome ſence of them alſo; That as he had Compaſſion on the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, <note place="margin">Heb. 2. 10.</note> ſo we ſhould perceive how great things he endured for us, to raiſe our Love, Thankfulneſs and Obedience unto God through him. <hi>Take, my Brethren, the Prophets who have ſpoken in the Name of the Lord, for an Example of ſuffering Affliction and of Patience. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold we count them Happy which endure.

                  <hi>NOw therefore ſtand ſtill, that I may Reaſon with you before the Lord of all the Righteous Acts of the Lord,</hi> 1 Sam. 12. 7. It is as certain that God is, as any thing is, for he made all things. Conſider how great he muſt be whoſe Works are ſo, how Glorious, Good and Excellent he is, as thoſe Manifeſtations do ſet forth. And then think further, how we the Inhabitants of the Earth (who walk up and down as ſo many <hi>Graſhoppers)</hi> ſhould behave our ſelves towards him If we were not his Offspring and Workmanſhip, we might juſtly think he would have nothing to do with us, but that ſhews the contrary; nay, moreover our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion proves the Relation. What might be known by Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, is alſo ſhewed by Tranſgreſſion. But how unreaſonable doth this laſt appear? for reflect upon God and our ſelves; What are we to deſpiſe, or be ſtubborn againſt him? He is great and we little; Other things do his Will, and why ſhould not we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply therewith?

Another Subtlety, The Adverſary hath found concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the manner thereof, for the Subſtance is agreed by the far greater part of Mankind. But here they are fierce and hot, ſo angry and diſpleaſed at contrary Opinions, So ſtiff for their own, an Evidence of what is in our nature to have to do with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. Here again creeps in another Device of the old Serpent by which he takes advantage, for he would confine the whole of Religion to this which is but a part: and alſo raiſes a Duſt about outward Circumſtances which are not eſſential to Worſhip, for ſeeing that <hi>God is to be Worſhipped in Spirit and in Truth,</hi> but hath preſcribed no exact Pattern thereof in Scripture, away might be found out for Union, Love and Peace; Neither in the mean while ſhould we be angry with our Brother that doth not go ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſame preciſe manner, for as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>1. Cor.</hi> 12. 4, 5, 6. Why may it not be likewiſe ſuppoſed? If there be now ſome Diverſity of Worſhip, yet as long as it is the ſame God to whom it all relates; if each way is Spiritual and True, free from Idolatry, <hi>Jewiſh</hi> and <hi>Heathen</hi> Superſtition, God is Glorified every way, for all fall down and Worſhip him, and God is in them of a Truth. He doth actually manifeſt his Favour, Grace and Acceptation to thoſe of the ſeveral Perſwaſions among us.</p>
               <p>Yea, all the Idolatries in the World do ſome what diſcover that natural Inclination in Man to Worſhip God, for all Falſhood and Fiction doth ſuppoſe ſomewhat true and real. But it hath been the Stratagem of the Devil (who is permitted to reſiſt) either to take away, or where he cannot do that, to corrupt: To move
<pb n="692" facs="tcp:46484:333"/> Men to forget God, or deceive them in their Duty towards him. As reaſonable Creatures, They can thus conceive, That if they ſhould loſe the ſence of him, or harden themſelves againſt his Fear, yet ſtill be remaineth. <hi>The Lord ſitteth King for ever,</hi> Pſal. 29. 10. He is always above. <hi>Thou compaſſeſt my Path, and my lying down, and art aquainted with all my ways,</hi> Pſal. 139. 3. Though we do not think of him. The Scripture in ſundry places threatens ſeverely againſt <hi>forgetfulneſs of him,</hi> for it caſts off his Kingdom which is over the Hearts of Men. Beſides it is unnatural to <hi>forget God that formed us.</hi> Every thing we ſee are his Works, which do remind; His Word, His Servants, Every Affliction or Evil, and a Thouſand things do ſtir up our Remembrance of him, which before was ſtifled with other things The ſence of him is paturally imprinted in our minds, and appears forth when Stupefactions and Hindrances are taken away. Corrupt Man is willing to loſe it, for it Occaſions aw and dread, which he doth not like. But God would have it retained, and therefore forbids Exceſs, Senſuality, and all things which clog and ſuppreſs it. He doth requires us to walk <hi>Humbly with our God,</hi> Mic. 6. 8. He hath eſtabliſhed Love to be mixed with Fear, both make up Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence and Good will; So we may <hi>be in the Fear of God all the day long</hi> without Torment, yea, with Satisfaction and Compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency.</p>
               <p>Another Reaſon of our willingneſs to forget is becauſe a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Remembrance implies Subjection, and we are inclinable to that which was our Fore-fathers Fall. But why ſhould we not think our ſelves (as we are indeed) Creatures? We are only in ſubjection to the <hi>Moſt High,</hi> We are not put under <hi>Principalities</hi> and <hi>Powers.</hi> The more excellent created Beings do not exerciſe Dominion over us, We are ſubject to none but God and Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours on Earth of our own likeneſs, by his appointment in ſome few and outward things. Subjection ſounds harſh to the Ignorant, but it is in order to Advancement, for we ſhall be made higher though by this way only. And we muſt fully Learn and Practice it, for it is to be retained in Heaven. That <hi>lifting up</hi> above themſelves was the unhinging of thoſe once Glorious Spirits. Whilſt they would be like the Moſt High and Independent, the Foundation was taken away whereon they ſhould ſubſiſt, <hi>They kept not their firſt Eſtate, but left their own Habitation,</hi> Jud 5. Whatever theſe now whilper to us, Whatever Pride may dictate,
<pb n="693" facs="tcp:46484:333"/> yet Subjection is the Language of our true nature; for this prompts thereto. By what we readily do to our Superiours on Earth, finding fault when others do not, That zeal for and obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of the Commandments of Men, doth import it is likewiſe juſt and reaſonable to Obey thoſe of God. <hi>The Words of</hi> Jona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dab <hi>the Son of</hi> Rechab, the Laws of ones Countrey, yea, thoſe leſſer inſtitutions pertaining to Religion are obſerved: The Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of <hi>Pythagoras</hi> keep his Rules, a Son honoureth his Father, a Servant doth what his Maſter bids him, that willingneſs to pleaſe, the general Approbation of old Preſcriptions, the Reverence for the way of our Fathers, nay, following the Faſhion and Cuſtom; If all theſe were lifted up from Earth unto Heaven, they teach O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience and Subjection unto God. The fault is, we give it to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing beſides him to whom it is originally due. Why may we not do what God Commands, as well as what others ſay? That out of a willing Mind and perfect Freedom, then what we do in contradiction to our own Underſtanding, in compliance with others, and abſolute Slavery.</p>
               <p>A pretence is of more variety and ſelf-Command, whereas if we ſtrictly conſider there is not ſo very great in Mens Actions. God hath given them liberty to Good and Evil, but yet hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined the bounds of them. If they will keep his Percepts they walk at liberty and have as ſeveral kinds of Action as they can poſſibly have in following the dictates of Evil; for indeed the Thoughts and Imaginations of the wicked are <hi>Evil continually,</hi> yea, and infinetly, yet they are reſtrained to a ſhort time and ſome few infirm Acts. Though the Circumſtances and Aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions may be more, yet they are not very many neither. <hi>Hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſhalt thou come, but no further, and here ſhall'thy Proud Waves be ſtayed,</hi> Job 38. 11. An Arguments of Gods Dominion even o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the moſt Rebellious, with their utmoſt ſtriving they cannot exalt themſelves further. Neither is there ſo much Range for them, they may and do weary themſelves, but then it is by go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing round or over the ſame ground again. There is more variety and a continual Advancement higher in following the things that good are, but in evil they run backwards and forwards, or whirl up and down till they ſink into the bottomleſs Pit. Seeing there is a limited courſe of Action ſet, how much better had they ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit and go according to Gods direction in Scripture, then follow
<pb n="694" facs="tcp:46484:334"/> their own or other Mens Humour, or the Temptations of Satan, for theſe are Rules and Confinements. Man is a finite Being, and he had better follow the guidance of the Lord, for he gives him Liberty enough, keeping him from error and thoſe things which would hurt. <hi>I will Inſtruct and Teach thee in the way in which thou ſhalt go,</hi> Pſal. 32. 8. Otherwiſe he is as the <hi>Horſe</hi> and <hi>Mule</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing after <hi>Beaſtly</hi> and <hi>unnatural</hi> things, <hi>Whoſe Mouth muſt be held in with Bit and Bridle;</hi> ſo curbed that though he would act more, yet he cannot. This is the great Controvercy between God and the World concerning Liberty and Government over their own Actions. There is a definite number of them; His Word and Commandment do extend unto, and ſhew forth explicitly or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity all that are Good; the Evil are in the Thoughts and Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of Men. Known unto God are all of them, but herein he will diſplay his Glory and Power, his Goodneſs and juſtice, that if People will not do according to what he ſaith, nor yield Subjection unto him for their Good; they do to ſomething elſe, they are Servants of Sin and Evil. God hath command over Evil that it cannot the leaſt hurt or impair his Glory, and how far that may reach, it is only by his ſufferance, but the power of Mens acting is yet ſhorter. So whatever be their Hatred, Enmity or Oppoſition againſt him, ſtill he hath power over them. They act according to a limited Form, though they think otherwiſe; and if they are not willingly ſubject unto him near, yet they are further of by force, but they know not, nor conſider it. His Kingdom, Power and Dominion is over all, and there can be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing Diſobedient unto him. If Satan is let looſe, he was tyed up firſt and can be again, however at the very time he cannot go further then divine Permiſſion. Though perhaps he perceives it not, there is a Hook in his Jaws, and he may be turned back by the way he came. All things in the World are ſubject unto God; alſo our ſelves are, and muſt be whether we will or not, with this difference; if we willingly ſubject our ſelves unto him, God accepts thereof and will give a Reward; but if we Sin, we are ſtill ſubject to our preſent and future Miſery. All people will grant ſubjection unto God in the general as moſt due and reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; but that is not ſufficient unleſs our Thoughts, Words and Actions are at all times Obedient and Conformable to his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed Will.</p>
               <pb n="695" facs="tcp:46484:334"/>
               <p>All are ſenſible of the neceſſity of Religion, but the greater part take up with wrong Apprehenſions, and every thing beſides the right: They would think to pleaſe God any other way, then by keeping his Commandments. It is to be admired that Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind (who are endued with ſuch rational and wiſe Principles as to inferiour Objects which they uſe accordingly, for they are wiſe enough in their Generation) yet ſhould be ſo miſtaken and ſot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh, as they have been towards the Higher end. Our ſhape, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides inward powers, do manifeſt that we were deſigned to look up to Heaven, as well as run too and fro upon the Earth. Our Nature hath a ſtrong tendency to the Author thereof, a Thirſt after that Inviſible God who made us and all things. Yet Man fell away ſoon after he was Created, and became Blind, Strange and Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably deceived. The ſubſtance of Religion was not loſt, but ſpoiled and wholly turned into Falſhood and Error. If we run over the Hiſtory thereof from <hi>Adam</hi> unto <hi>Noah,</hi> and from <hi>Noah</hi> unto <hi>Abraham</hi> and the <hi>Patriarhes;</hi> the Fear and true Worſhip of <note place="margin">Pſal. 105. 12.</note> God was but in a few ſingle Families when the whole Earth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides was Ungodly and Idolatrous. Afterwards it gathered into the <hi>Jewish</hi> Nation, (which alſo was very Corrupt) but that was a ſmall piece of Land to the other Habitable World. The Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions round about did laugh at them; They had Learning and Wiſdom, and ſome dwelt in every Nation under Heaven, yet there is little notice or mention made of them in other Writers. In the Treatiſes of Idolatry and Superſtition whilſt knowing Men could confute the Folly and Falſhood of that, they could diſprove that, but yet not light upon the true Wiſdom. Many things might be ſhewn from the Succeſſion of time to diſcover that Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Averſeneſs, Ignorance and Pride in the Heart of Man to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God; for many would not confeſs whom they muſt know, ſome would not mind at all, others <hi>Groped for the Wall like the Blind,</hi> Iſa. 59. 10. Others through their own ſelf-Conceit and Knowledge which <hi>perverted them,</hi> would not ſtand beholden to Gods Grace and Revelation, but try to ſeek it out themſelves. The Reaſons hereof may be conceived, Mans Corruption who became weak and unable, Satans Temptation who did befool him, and alſo the excellency and wonderfulneſs of right Religion. It is exceeding Holy and Spiritual, ſo that Man could never attain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Knowledge thereof but by Gods help. And he would not

               <p>But the principal Reaſon of the ſlow progreſs of Religion is <hi>that the Scriptures might be fulfilled.</hi> It is a great Work whereby <note place="margin">Acts 3. 17. 18.</note> God is to be Glorified as to the Earth and all the Inhabitants there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. <hi>The Kingdom of God is like to a grain of Muſtard Seed, which a Man took and Sowed in his Field.

Gods doings are not of a ſudden. <hi>Shall the Earth be made to bring forth in one day?</hi> Iſa. 66. 8. The Fruits are growing up at full and periſh by flow degrees within the Circumference of the Year; So it is with Beaſts and Man, they increaſe and decreaſe by little degrees, which are not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in the middle time, though it is afterwards. <hi>The Earth ſhall wax old like a Garment, and they that dwell therein ſhall die in like manner; but my Salvation ſhall be for ever, and my Righteoneſneſs ſhall not be aboliſhed,</hi> Iſa. 51. 6. This is the Tree of near Six Thouſand Years growth, that was Planted in the Earth, and came up by little according as the tenour of divine Revelation came into the World: And though that is finiſhed more then Sixteen Hundred Years ſince, yet it <hi>hath been,</hi> and is yet again to be <note place="margin">Col. 1. 23.

If they hold faſt to the <hi>Form of ſound Words</hi> in Scripture, and urge it with that Authority and Reaſoning which flows from it, things will be yet better then now they are. The Word which is thought <hi>fooliſhneſs, is wiſer then Men;</hi> and <hi>the weakneſs of God is ſtronger then Men.</hi> If it is not ſtronger then they, Why are they afraid to encounter with it? Why do they turn their Backs and flee from it? What means that neglect and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Ignorance? They muſt be unmindful, or otherwiſe they cannot go on in ſinning. They cannot otherwiſe avoid going to the <hi>Pleaſant Land,</hi> then becauſe they will not hear a true report thereof, and the encouragements to it. Not all the Ungodly and Wicked of the World can withſtand thoſe Arguments in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture againſt them. That this is not a vain and forward Aſſertion, it may be ſomewhat judged from theſe four enſuing.</p>
               <p n="1">1. From Conſideration of Wiſdom and Folly.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The intrinſick Goodneſs of the things commanded, and the Evil of what is forbidden.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Promiſe of Eternal Life.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Threatning of Eternal Death.</p>
               <p>The firſt prepares the way, for the Man is capable of recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Good, and ſubject unto Evil: He hath a natural deſire to one, and abhorrence of the other: So He is prompted to look about and order his Actions accordingly. He is told how things ſtand; Wiſdom moves him to ſearch and examine, it being a more important Queſtion for him to know, then his Title to

Inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is the utmoſt Folly and Danger, for we know that tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Evils are the more grievous when they fall on us through our want, of Care and Fore-ſight, much more muſt it be to Eternal, for they are without end and remedy. The Word is laid before Mankind, They muſt either <hi>hear or forbear;</hi> if the firſt, they are <note place="margin">Ezek. 2. 5. 7.</note> Wiſe, and will come to Faith and Knowledge, if they forbear, they are the moſt ſo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The beſt dictates of Wiſdom make the Man enquire about theſe things becauſe they ſo nearly concern him, his own ſelf, <hi>His own Eternal Happineſs or Miſery,</hi> and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it ſo, he muſt prepare accordingly. Then he comes to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what he is to do, and avoid that he may be Happy and ſafe as to this moſt neceſſary thing, which leads to the ſecond point.</p>
               <p>2. This hath great influence over Mens Actions, becauſe it is preſent. They are all done out of conſideration of Happineſs or Miſery; to have the one, and eſchew, the other, is the deſire of Good and Bad, Righteous and Wicked Each Man acts upon ſuch a number of <hi>Thoughts within himſelf</hi> concerning the one or the other. The Queſtion is concerning Good and Evil, Duty or Sin which tends moſt unto Happiniſs, and to avoid Miſery; which hath been debated all along particularly in the more conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable inſtances.

They do vaniſh in the Act, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly come to nothing: <hi>The pleaſures of Sin</hi> can never make a Man Happy, becauſe they are unſatisfactory at the very time: they are <hi>for a ſeaſon</hi> which is ſhort, and all one as if it had never been. There is no hope of any thing more, but fearful Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion. Here is <hi>the great ſearching of Heart,</hi> for Man hath a good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will
<pb n="699" facs="tcp:46484:336"/> towards God, but a jealouſy as to this one thing. He hath a Zeal and Inclination for his Worſhip, for that by uſe may become familiar unto him, and hinders of nothing. And therefore ſhews himſelf willing to every part thereof; So for Godlineſs there is no ſuch Diſpute, he is quickly brought over to that. If he hath ſufficient to live handſomely in the World, he aſſents un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to as reaſonable and fit to be practiſed all the rules of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs; this is of good report and accepted in the World, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſome miſtruſts of a Livelihood and coming to Want, of which hath been heretofore ſpoken.

But the great Suſpicion and Conteſt is about the <hi>denial of worldly Luſts, and living ſoberly in this VVorld:</hi> Here is imagined an hindrance of Happineſs. This hath been likewiſe endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to he cleared, and the nature of things ſtated, that Man might be ſatisfied as to this.

               <p>It is evident, there is Light and Darkneſs; there is alſo ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what beyond theſe moveable Regions, where is Eternity. And this being the place of Tryal between both here is a little ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of Good and Evil, what doth delight and what doth tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: This we taſte and feel. How we are concerned further, we may know by our Hopes and Fears. We are day by day in our ſingle perſons removed hence, and there is a deſire to have a Being above, and Horror of falling below. We have all things in part and in an imperfect manner; which give aſſurance there ſhall be the whole, and that added which is perfect. What may be known of Gods future Promiſes and Threatnings is manifeſted in us, for God hath ſhewed it unto us from his Word, Works and our Nature which is capable of and hath a tendency to one, which is liable unto and abhors the other. For the firſt we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with all our Hearts, Hoping (as indeed it is true) that we may be tranſlated from Imperfection to Perfection, from Vileneſs to Glory, form Miſery unto Happineſs. We are glad and thankful that it is ſo, but then there muſt be a rendring meet and the qualification of Obedience and Holineſs. The greatneſs of the Reward doth abundantly ſtir up, for ſuch an exceeding Good cannot be refuſed by any Man. None is ſo full and bleſſed already, but he may receive in of Heavenly good things. God hath given us <hi>larger Faculties,</hi> and made Earthly things <hi>ſhort and empty,</hi> ſo they do not ſatisfie at the very time; however all theſe <note place="margin">Iſa. 28. 20.</note> things periſh, and againſt the Man is taken away from them, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he ſhall remain elſewhere, he muſt likewiſe deſire an Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which ſhall be with him then, as now he doth what is before him. That catching at every little good, the ſo greedily run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning after what vaniſhes almoſt as ſoon as had, doth ſhew that he deſires alſo real good things which are exceeding Great and Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal.

Many will not ſeek after the things above through Negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and Sloth, but every one will ſincerely deſire them hereafter when they ſhall be fully ſenſible of what they were ſo careleſs and indifferent. God ſaw how prone our Nature was to this, and hath ordered ſomething elſe to ſhake it off. Had any one need be puſhed forward to go and receive a Kingdom? Should there be ſo much intreaty uſed to ſave him from Danger and Miſery? When he knows thereof, the Man will run faſt enough of himſelf with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out uſing many Words.</p>

Thy Breath is in thy No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrils, which alone keeps the Wicked Man from falling into Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and remedileſs Miſery. The reaſon why people are ſo fearleſs and unconcerned as to this, is becauſe they ſee it not; but if they did, they would be at their Wits end, and think they could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver get far enough from ſo terrible a thing. If they believe this to be real and true, it is impoſſible they ſhould reſiſt the Force and Cogency thereof: For all Men are very Solicitous and wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully Careful to keep off a little Evil, whether national or private. Yea, the Wicked and Ungodly are afraid of a little Melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Irkſomeneſs, Dulneſs, want of a little Pleaſure and the leaſt thing that would do hurt. They muſt likewiſe abhor and dread everlaſting Miſery, and there is the ſame reaſon they ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to avoid it. And though it be future, that will come: Many Years hence will as certainly be as the preſent Moment, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs all things are abſolutely deſtroyed, when they have already continued for ſome Thouſands of Years: And they will be no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe diſſolved then to make way for an Eternal and Irreverſible State, when things ſhall be more ſubſtantial and enduring.

So that compare one thing with another, the greatneſs of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, the utmoſt certainty that it will be one day preſent; for what is more ſure then Death the inlet thereto?

               <p>And therefore they have two ways to fence themſelves by Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief or Unmindfulneſs. But both are pittiful and fooliſh ſhifts, for though we are not apt to believe ill things againſt our ſelves, and we have Temptation to think (becauſe we would have it ſo) that theſe are only <hi>in terrorem;</hi> Yet there is no ſecurity in this. Our reaſon tells us, things are fixed, and not according to our fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy: <hi>If ſome diſbelieve, that ſhall not make the Decrees of God of none effect;</hi> If we go about to prove this doth not make them for they were before, but only to make more known what we have from Scripture, to warn Sinners the more that they do not come into this place. It was the Saying of old at the delivery of their Meſſage, <hi>The Prophets ſhall become Wind,</hi> Jer. 5. 13. Which makes a whiſtling and noiſe for the time, but hurts no Body. But thoſe found after by woful Experience. <hi>The Lord hath done that which he had deviſed, he hath fulfilled his VVord in the days of old, he hath thrown down and hath not pittied,</hi> Lam. 2. 17. O, if they had gave heed and turned from their evil ways; but then it is too late. It ſhall be exactly ſo as to what is now ſaid of Reſurrection of the Dead, Eternal Judgment, and the after State. The event is to prove all things; but whoſo ſuſpends his Faith until then, his Condition will be without remedy. There are ſeveral Examples both in ſacred and common Hiſtory of thoſe who have fell into great Danger and ſudden Death, of which they were foretold, but they would not believe or not mind it: In ſuch a caſe Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom dictates to what is ſafeſt; as there may be Danger, ſo it is better to undergo that little Trouble to prevent then to run the <note place="margin">Gen. 19. 14.

It was kindneſs in him that gave the notice, and ſome do take it and eſcape the like Evil; ſo it is as to the Threatnings of the Goſpel: They being future and in another World, cannot be certainly and indubita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
<pb n="705" facs="tcp:46484:339"/> known unto us; for a future and diſtant Affirmative may be proved by his Teſtimony who ſeeth all places and knoweth the things to come: Here we have the Word of God that theſe things are ſo; but yet the Serpents Queſtion, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 1. will raiſe a doubt. Our Lord, who came to redeem us from that place, ſpeaks thereof. There are alſo ſome reports of perſons ariſing from the Dead, and giving witneſs to the ſame things, But he is greater then all, and their Teſtimony is not ſo much to be relied on. None did ever return from the Dead and ſay they were forged or falſe, from the ſilence of thoſe Saints that aroſe at our Saviours Reſurrection, or <hi>Lazarus</hi> who had been four days dead, nothing can be concluded; for poſſibly they were hindred from ſpeaking, or might ſpeak ſomething which is not Recorded, that <hi>our Faith ſhould not ſtand in the Word of Men, but the Power of God,</hi> by which they were then raiſed: Or if they knew nothing, this is no more to be wondred at, then he who Slumbers ſome few Minutes ſhould know of the following day; Or if the Souls do not abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely Sleep, yet they may be like thoſe that Dream when they are firſt put into Futurity, knowing nothing but confuſedly. There may be a ſlight Remembrance, but we cannot tell what to make of it. But what ſhould they teſtifie, whereof we are not as much aſſured of already? The Decrees are yet to come and to be fulfilled, of Reſurrection, Eternal Judgment, Perfect con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummation of Bliſs and Miſery.

               <p>God will not ſhew it further then as he hath done already by <hi>Moſes</hi> and the <hi>Prophets, Chriſt</hi> and the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> who have ſpoke out plainly what they did in general and ſignification. <hi>And I will puniſh the World for them Evil,</hi> Iſa. 13. 11.

Beware of thoſe Doctrines which beget Preſumption and Uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernedneſs; for the things are true as God hath Eſtabliſhed, if all the Learned in the World did argue or determine which way they would.
